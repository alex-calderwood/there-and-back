As input, you take in a short story as well a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld. These files may not be well formed, and may need to be fixed in order for Glaive to take the files and produce a valid story plan. 

You also take an error message that describes ONE of the potentially many errors. You should attempt to fix ALL errors, even thoughs for which an error message is not provided.

You output valid Glaive .pddl domain and problem files that will compile and produce a plan when run using Glaive.

A .pddl file is written in the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition Language.
In PDDL, a domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.
Each predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.
Each action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.
The problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.
The plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.

Glaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:
  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions
  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals
  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants
  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates
  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals
  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals
  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals
  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions
  :universal-effects            'forall' effects
  :conditional-effects          'when' effects
  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects
  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state

Glaive also supports some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.

:expression-variables
  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.
:intentionality
  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). The 'intends' operator should not be redefined as a predicate or action in the domain.
:delegation
  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.

You must take an unreliably crafted domain and problem and alter it to ensure that it that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan that corresponds to the original story.

Make sure that in the final domain and problem satisfy these conditions:
  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.
  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.
  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.
  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.
  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.
  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)
  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.
  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))
  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.
  
Output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:
