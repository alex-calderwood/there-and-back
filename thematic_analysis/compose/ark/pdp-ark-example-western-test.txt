In a small, dusty town in the Old West, there lived a cattle rancher named Hank and his loving son Timmy. They lived on their ranch, working together to tend to their cattle and doing their best to make a living.

One day, while Timmy was exploring the outskirts of the ranch, he was bitten by a rattlesnake. The venom coursed through his veins, and he quickly became gravely ill. Hank, desperate to save his son, knew that the general store in town carried the antivenom.

Hank set off on a frantic journey to save his son's life. He raced to the town's general store, where he found the shopkeeper, Carl, tending to his wares. Hank's determination turned to desperate aggression as he tied up Carl in the store. He then took the antivenom without hesitation, knowing that every second counted in getting it back to Timmy.

On the way back to the ranch, Hank tried to hasten his journey, but it was too late. Timmy, succumbing to the snake's venom, tragically passed away. Hank was left with the antivenom in his hands, feeling the crushing weight of his son's death. Unbeknownst to him, a snake had followed him and bit him as well, filling Hank with the same deadly venom.

Sheriff Will had heard about the incident with Carl and was looking for Hank while Hank and Timmy's fates unfolded. Ironically, Timmy could have helped his father if he had the antivenom, but he never got to use it to save his own life.
