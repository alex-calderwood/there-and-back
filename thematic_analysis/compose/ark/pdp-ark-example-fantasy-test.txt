Once upon a time, in a quaint village, there lived a beautiful woman named Talia. She was loved by two men, Rory and Vince. Talia loved Rory, who was kind and gentle, while Vince, who was rich, loved her too. The village was not far from a cave, where a fearsome monster named Gargax lived. Many unfortunate souls had ventured too close to his lair, only to lose their lives or possessions.

One day, with a hopeful heart, Rory decided to propose to Talia in their village. Talia, full of joy, happily accepted his proposal, and they began making plans for their life together. However, Rory knew that he had to provide for his future wife, and he heard tales of a great treasure hidden within the monster's cave. Despite the dangers, he made the decision to travel to Gargax's lair in order to claim the treasure.

Meanwhile, Vince, heartbroken and envious of the love Talia and Rory shared, made no attempt to interfere with their happiness. He continued his life in the village, showers of gold coins hiding the disappointment within.

Rory, determined, ventured into the perilous cave, quietly stealing the treasure from Gargax. With a newfound sense of courage and wealth, Rory made his way back to the village, ready to start a new life with Talia.

On his return, he and Talia were married in a simple but beautiful ceremony, surrounded by their friends and family. The treasure Rory had stolen ensured they lived a rich and happy life together, while Vince, despite his wealth, could only watch from afar.

As for Gargax, he continued to lurk in his cave, his hunger for riches and revenge growing stronger. The villagers whispered of his plans, warning others to stay far away from the cave. The tale of Rory's bravery and love for Talia lived on, serving as a lesson for all who dared to challenge the mighty Gargax.
