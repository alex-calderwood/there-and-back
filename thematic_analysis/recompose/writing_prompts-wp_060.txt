Sweat dripped from Mr. Anglewood's brow as he slaved over the weathered metal. Stroke after stroke, his face blossomed into a reddish purple, the weight of his body sinking into his routine. The iron cast began to shimmer, it's rust removing with each pass of the cloth. His chair was weeping, the wood screaming to be released from its captor. Mrs. Anglewood watched nervously from the kitchen, idly holding the letter of approval.

" She's been dead for years, honey. Do you really think this will give you any peace? "

If Mr. Anglwood heard her, he showed no sign of it. Her breathing quivered. She knew her husband would not be persuaded from his path, so she began sobbing softly, fleeing to hide behind a door that locked. She threw the letter towards the refrigerator, and it landed soundlessly on the kitchen counter.

Unchanged, Mr. Anglewood remained focused on the process at hand. He had heard his wife's words, but did not care for her distress. Admittedly, performing maintenance in the living room was a tad dramatic, but he always liked to witness the effects of his actions, especially after the war. Unfortunately, Mr. Anglewood had grown too fat to fit in his uniform, and would have to continue on without it. He simply did not have the time to make proper adjustments without his wife's help. So he sat stroking the metal with his brush, waiting for the time to pass. The hunt would begin in less then an hour, and Mr. Anglewood needed his rifle to be clean.

The luxurious Anglewood Manor stood on the outskirts of a quaint little town. Mr. and Mrs. Anglewood, the wealthy proprietors of the estate, were going about their daily routines.

Mr. Anglewood, a well-regarded businessman and an avid hunter, found himself in the living room inspecting his rifle for an upcoming hunting expedition. The rifle was a well-crafted and reliable tool, but it had seen some wear and tear from years of usage. He decided that it was time to give it a thorough cleaning to ensure optimum performance on the field. With great care, he removed the rifle's components and meticulously cleaned each part before reassembling it.

While her husband had his mind focused on the hunt, Mrs. Anglewood was preoccupied with her own tasks in the kitchen. She had just received an important letter that required her immediate attention. Concerned about the safety of their home, she decided that locking the front door would be a wise precaution. She fetched the key and locked the door, securing their mansion and providing a heightened sense of security.

Back in the living room, Mr. Anglewood turned his attention to his hunting uniform, a well-worn ensemble that had been with him on countless outings. He tried to put it on, only to realize that it no longer fit him quite right â€” the passing years had taken their toll. Undeterred, he made the necessary adjustments and tailored the uniform to his current measurements. As a man of resourcefulness and determination, he was set on ensuring his hunting attire was both comfortable and functional for his next expedition.

With the rifle now gleaming and functioning at peak capacity, and his uniform properly fitted, Mr. Anglewood was prepared to embark on his latest hunting adventure. Meanwhile, Mrs. Anglewood had tended to the pressing matter in the letter, and together, they had successfully secured their home.

As the day drew to a close, the couple found satisfaction in their accomplishments. Their manor exuded a sense of safety, and Mr. Anglewood's hunting preparations were complete. Anglewood Manor was once again a bastion of peace and prosperity.

At Anglewood Manor, Mr. and Mrs. Anglewood were preparing for a grand hunt. Appropriate attire was essential, and Mr. Anglewood had meticulously laid out his hunting uniform and rifle. The rifle, however, was not yet cleaned, and the uniform needed to be adjusted to fit properly. Mrs. Anglewood, on the other hand, was busy attending to other matters. She wanted to ensure that the manor remained secure while they were gone. Carrying a letter with important instructions, she made her way to the kitchen.

In the living room, Mr. Anglewood carefully inspected his rifle, noticing that it needed to be cleaned before the hunt. Determined to have his weapon in top condition, he carefully cleaned and polished the rifle, ensuring that it would function smoothly during the hunt.

While Mr. Anglewood tended to his rifle, Mrs. Anglewood locked the door to the manor from the kitchen. With the letter still in her hand, she secured the premises, providing peace of mind while they were away. She had no intentions of letting any unwanted guests enter the manor while they were out hunting.

After cleaning his rifle, Mr. Anglewood turned his attention to his hunting uniform. The uniform had been tailored for him, but over time it had become a bit too snug. He diligently adjusted the uniform, ensuring that it would fit him perfectly during the hunt. Once the adjustments were complete, Mr. Anglewood donned his uniform, looking dapper and ready for their grand adventure.

With the rifle cleaned, the uniform adjusted and worn, and the door locked, the Anglewoods were finally prepared for their grand hunt. They were assured that they had taken all necessary precautions, guaranteeing a day filled with excitement and, ultimately, a triumphant return to their secure home at Anglewood Manor.
