Her eyes searched over the audience. Applause filled the room, reverberating off of the walls and bathing her in their adoration. This was it. This was the moment she had been waiting for. She dreamed of standing here, her arms open and taking a bow, ever since she was a child.

" Thank you. Thank you so much, " she shouted out to the audience. And then she waved her hand through the air, performing the last trick for the night, the first night of many to come. She threw the ball down at the ground triumphantly. A flash of light, a puff of smoke, and she was gone.

Her assistant came running up to her backstage.

" Wow, that was amazing, " the assistant exclaimed !

" I know. I can ' t believe they actually liked it so much, " the magician said in disbelief. " With that kind of audience and that level of excitement, I think we ' ll be performing here long into the future. "

She sat in a chair and contemplated the entire evening. Finally, she was satisfied with her life. She was where she was meant to be, and she was going to enjoy putting on a show every week.
