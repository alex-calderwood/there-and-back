As if looking back at a sun-cast shadow, only to realise just how far it had moved while I looked away, I started at my face in the mirror.

It was my face, surely. I knew it was my face. It looked like me, and yet it didn't quite look like me. It did not look like me as I thought I looked. It was indescribable, as nearly everything that seemed different seemed exactly the same as before.

Worse still was that I knew why I looked like I did not remember looking. Simply knowing it would happen, as it was happening, caused me to forget that it had happened. And so I did not see it.

The sadness of my mistakes hung beneath my eyes ; the joy of my successes lined my mouth and lips from raising so many smiles. The fury of my youth ceased my forehead, while wisdom and forgiveness smoothed my eyes into soothing glass.

I have come a very long way ; done so much with my time. I examined my new-old face and the life that shaped it, memorizing how I looked to compare with the next time I saw a new face in my mirror.

<|story|>

Once upon a time, in a quiet neighborhood, there lived a protagonist who went by the name of John. John lived an ordinary, uneventful life and went through his mundane days without much excitement or emotional outburst. However, one day, John decided to embrace the full spectrum of emotions and seek a deeper understanding of himself.

John began the journey of self-exploration by intentionally experiencing a wide range of emotions. The first emotion he experienced was sadness, triggered by the memory of a heart-wrenching break-up. As tears streamed down his face, John felt the weight of the sorrow and embraced it, knowing it would lead him to grow.

Next, John decided to experience joy. He reflected on a sunny day spent under the cherry blossoms with dear friends, and a warm, radiant sense of happiness filled his chest. As he laughed at the fond memories, he acknowledged that joy was a crucial part of life, just as important as sadness.

The third emotion John set out to experience was fury. He remembered a time when he had been betrayed by a confidante and, with balled fists and tightened jaw, allowed the anger to course through his veins. This emotion taught him the importance of boundaries and standing up for oneself.

Having experienced both negative and positive emotions, John sought out wisdom. He reached out to his mentor, an elderly woman who had lived a rich and fulfilling life. Through their conversations, John gained invaluable insights about the complexities of human emotions and the importance of embracing all of them.

Finally, John chose to experience forgiveness. He recalled the same confidante who had betrayed him, and made the conscious decision to release the lingering resentment. Liberated from the heavy burden of anger, John realized that forgiveness was a necessary step towards healing and growth.

One morning, as John looked into the mirror, he noticed subtle changes in his appearance. The lines on his face seemed to tell a story of his emotional journey, and he realized he had evolved during this period of reflection. He decided to memorize his current appearance as a reminder of the journey he had undertaken.

In the end, John conquered each emotion and, in the process, gained a deeper understanding of himself and the human experience. By embracing sadness, joy, fury, wisdom, and forgiveness, he had found a new appreciation for life and the complex emotions that make us who we are.
