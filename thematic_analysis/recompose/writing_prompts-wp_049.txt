" Ori, come. "
She hopped to her feet spryly and followed her Master out of the Aeon ' s room. She listened. She always listened. It ' s what good dogs do, she told herself happily, and she was a good dog. As she padded after her Master, she noticed something was amiss. The Master smelled differently, he held himself differently, he breathed differently. She didn ' t understand what was wrong with Master, but when she heard him say " L-let ' s go for walk… " the catch in his voice stirred something ancient, something primal within her. Worry, and a desire to be as close as possible to her Master overcame her so strongly. She wanted to say, " Are you okay? " but could only manage a low pitiful whimper as she snuggled up to her Master who now sat shuddering on the stair with her leash in hand.

" He needs a W-A-L-K, " a soft, loving, motherly voice came from above her. She side eye ' d the source—a great big black yak of a dog. This was Boo, The One Before. Boo ' s features shifted and changed as she sat looking at the Master with her tail swishing back and forth softly on the hardwood floor. Grey and white whiskers blended in ebbs and flows across the night black of her beautiful coat, seeming to mark her as both an Old Bone and a Young Pup at the same time. All the while, The One Before ' s eyes shown like the Great of Eye of Night—a constant across her ever changing features that somehow, made her more the same.

" Of course he does, Boo, " Ori responded with no small amount of impatience. This was always The One Before ' s advice. Master is sleepy? He needs a walk. Master is mad? He needs a walk. Master is uncomfortable? He needs a walk. Master is Hungry? He needs a walk. Master is…
Ori nuzzled her Master once again, and gave a louder whimper. Nothing. She gave a snort of frustration, stretched to bleed off the mounting energy, and stamped her feet. " But he already knows he needs a W-A-L-K ! " she looked pleadingly at the guardian, " just look at his eyes, he ' s so far from the Herenow, I can ' t reach him ! "

The One Before ' s tail stopped wagging, and she cocked her head to the side in thought. " You must remember the ancient ways and oaths of our kin, young pup. Do as I do. " Slowly, and softly The One Before padded over to the Master. As she did, Ori saw the Others step out of the ether and join Boo at The Spot at the Master ' s side. Each overlapping their forms at The Spot until Ori could not tell one guardian from another, and all that was left was the shifting form of Canis, with it ' s Eyes of the Night. Ori reflected that some of these guardians had never even met her Master, or even the Aeon of her Master, but they were all of her House. That was the nature of The Bond, the oath taken over fire and cracked marrow so many dogtimes ago, that so entwined the fates of the guardians and masters. Ori stood in still wonder as The One Before spoke, " This is the Time of Passing, young pup, and you must be its Herald. Now come, take our Master for his first Walk, so that a new Aeon might begin. "
Immense pride swelled in Ori ' s chest as she walked the path of the guardians before her to The Spot at her Master ' s right hand. She placed her head on his knee and listened, and then after an eternity, she looked him in the eyes imploringly.
" Thanks for listening, " her Master sniffed as he hooked up her leash, and she led him out the door.
She always listened. It ' s what good dogs do.

Once upon a time, in the quiet little village of Dulore, there was a pair of guardian dogs named Ori and Boo. They were beloved by the villagers and held a sacred duty. These dogs were the last of their kind, descendants of an ancient lineage, bound by an ancient oath to bring harmony and balance to their human master. Their master, a wise man who had devoted his life to the village's betterment, had not yet experienced the power of the ancient oath.

One day, as the shadows grew long and the sun dipped low in the sky, the time came for Ori and Boo to remind their master of his forgotten purpose. They approached the master with gentle determination, their eyes filled with an otherworldly glow. The master sensed the importance of this moment and knew that the ancient oath must be honored.

As the dogs gazed deeply into the master's eyes, a profound sense of connection washed over him, and he felt the overwhelming need to go for a walk with Ori and Boo. The trio ventured forth, passing through the village and into the surrounding countryside. With every step, the master's mind and heart opened to the present moment, and he felt the deep significance of the ancient oath resonating through his being.

As they walked further, the master's awareness grew and merged with the pulse of life that surrounded them. The sun dipped below the horizon, and the world was bathed in a delicate twilight. The time of passing had come, a moment when the veil between realms was thin, and the power of the ancient oath could be fully realized.

With Ori and Boo by his side, the master stepped into the herenow, a place of pure presence and tranquility. Time seemed to stand still as the master released his burdens, fears, and attachments, and allowed the energy of the herenow to fill his being.

When they returned to the village, the master was forever changed. Ori and Boo had fulfilled their ancient duty, imparting the wisdom and harmony of the herenow upon their master. His newfound serenity radiated out to the villagers, and the entire community flourished with a renewed sense of balance and peace.

And so it was that Ori, Boo, and their master fulfilled the ancient oath, securing the enduring legacy of the guardian dogs and the timeless wisdom they protected.

Once upon a time, there were two noble dogs named Ori and Boo, guardians of an ancient oath. They had a sacred duty to bring their master to a mystical place called the Herenow. The Herenow was a magical space and time, where the master experienced great peace and presence.

The master had grown busy and distracted, often missing those magical moments in the Herenow. Ori and Boo watched from a distance, saddened, as their master's life seemed to pass by without experiencing the true beauty and wonder of living in the present moment.

One day, Ori glanced at Boo, and wordlessly, they both knew it was time to remind their master of the ancient oath. As the guardians, it was their duty to help the master in need.

Ori went to the master and gave a gentle reminder about the ancient oath. The master nodded, noticing the concern in Ori's eyes. The master understood the forgotten duty, and the need for a walk, to return to the Herenow.

As they walked, the master felt the worries and distractions fade away, replaced by the joy of the present moment. Ori, the loyal guardian, watched over the master with love.

It was then that the moment they had been waiting for arrived: the Time of Passing. The master, now connected to the present, was ready for whatever may come with grace and acceptance.

With Ori by the master's side, the Time of Passing occurred, and the master moved forward with newfound wisdom, forever grateful for the guardianship of Ori and Boo, the noble dogs who had kept the ancient oath alive.
