". . . a visitor " the old priest murmured.

I neatly palmed the crucifix into my jacket pocket and kept walking. The weight in my chest was heavier than the little wood in my pocket. A visitor.

Across the street the Auxiliaries sat there watching. I did my best not to look them in the eyes, afraid they 'd see the hate that lived in mine. Any gathering of Catholics was a threat to them, and Mass doubly so. I had no doubt that a few members of the parish were informers. Confession isn't just a sacrament.

I took the long way down Francis Street to the Liffey. Every few corners I 'd pass another group of soldiers or a constable and it felt as if the crucifix would burn a hole right through my coat. We hoped that if they found it when I was searched it would be ignored, or at least abused no differently than usual. If they kenned its secrets, prayer would do me very little good.

Crossing the river, I made my way to the simple town home I shared with two other families. Reliable people, we thought, who wouldn't take much notice of my visitor this evening. Still, I drew the shades down tight, and pushed the table in front of the door before I dared reach into my pocket.

I twisted the little figurine clockwise until it clicked. The spring inside pushed out a sliver of paper wrapped in a tight cylinder. I was always in awe of these little toys. . . the clever detail that deliberate hands had crafted. The same hands that might make a windup train for your kids or fix your father's watch. I rarely went into any of the jewelers ' shops, but I knew that somewhere in the city was another brave man fighting the struggle with those delicate hands.

My hands aren't for building things, but for breaking them.

I took the scrap of paper and unrolled it. Three red exes greeted me. Assassinations. Three men to kill. I took it over to the tiny brass candle tray and held it before the flame. In the heat the date 6 April 15 appeared before me. Swearing, I let the paper burn and then snuffed the candle. Two days. Two days !

Once I was sure all the pieces were burnt, I scraped the table away from the door and stepped cautiously into the garden. The high fence kept out inquiring eyes from the neighbors, and I had the only room that looked down into this little patch behind my home.

There in the yard was a cistern covered with a large flat rock. I stuck my arm down nearly to the elbow and felt along the underside of the well until I found the familiar rope. Gently, slowly, I pulled up the bucket with its oilskin bag. Hunched over the hole I was careful not to bring the bucket up any further than I had to. I reached in and felt the familiar weight of my Webley double action revolver. A sympathetic, or at least enterprising, quartermaster with the RIC had let a case of these go missing two years ago, and the boys had spread them around to the men of action like myself.

I took a box of cartridges too, deftly slipping the gun and rounds into my pocket that had so recently held the crucifix. Neatly, I lowered the barrel back down the hole and replaced the rock. A few quick scuffs of dirt and it looked as if it had never been disturbed. With a furtive glance about the yard, I returned to my home.

I spent the next few hours cleaning the gun, preparing the speed loader, and feeling the satisfying click click click of the action as I pulled the trigger. Satisified, I loaded it and snapped it shut. With its reassuring weight in my belt, I finished a quiet meal and waited for the knock on my door.

A visitor was coming to see me, one of the men who decides who lives and who dies. I never ask why, and I never fail to complete my mission. Four men are sitting at supper somewhere in the city, and in within fourth-eight hours three of us would be dead.

<|story|>

In a small Irish village, whispers of rebellion and resistance against oppression filled the air, creating an air of tension and unease. At the heart of this unrest was a secret group of rebels led by a fierce protagonist determined to avenge the suffering of the people.

One day, two informants were discovered within the churchâ€”a sacred place of refuge that had turned into a snake pit of betrayal. The protagonist, a dedicated fighter, aimed to eliminate these traitors to restore faith and keep their cause alive. Alongside their trusted auxiliaries, the protagonist prepared a plan to take out both informant1 and informant2.

Word of the protagonist's intent soon reached a mysterious foreign visitor who was staying at the protagonist's home. The visitor, as a fighter against tyranny in their homeland, shared a common bond with the protagonist. Seeing an opportunity to help a fellow rebel, the visitor became resolved to assist in the assassination of the informants.

After careful preparation and a pre-dawn rendezvous, the protagonist and visitor traveled to the protagonist's home to retrieve a hidden Webley pistol. With the powerful weapon in hand, they returned to the church as the auxiliaries kept watch.

It was within the crumbling walls of the church that the protagonist located the crucifix, a symbol of protection for their cause. They removed it from its hiding place and held it close, praying silently that their actions would lead to a brighter future for their people.

The visitor, meanwhile, took up a position by the church entrance to ensure no surprise attacks. With their hearts pounding, the protagonist and visitor confronted informant1 and informant2 and swiftly executed them, honoring the sacrifices made by the villagers for a freer, safer land.

As the echo of gunshots faded, the protagonist returned the crucifix to its hidden alcove. The visitor and protagonist shared a nod of mutual respect and understanding, knowing that they had taken a step towards restoring hope in their collective fight against tyranny. With the death of the traitors, the rebels remained resolute so long as the protagonist, the visitor, and the auxiliaries live to continue the struggle.

<|story|>

In a small town in the Irish countryside, a secret rebellion brewed against the oppressive government. The protagonist, a proud and determined Irishman, was at the heart of the resistance, along with a group of close-knit auxiliaries. They operated from the shadows, always wary of the informants who aimed to expose them.

Two notorious informants, known only as Informant1 and Informant2, had made their way into the protagonist's inner circle by false means and were now dangerously close to sabotaging the rebellion. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious visitor had arrived in town, sharing the same goal as the rebellion: to take down the snitches and secure the revolution.

It was a peculiar day, as the protagonist and the auxiliaries found themselves at the church, praying for their cause. Unsurprisingly, the informant duo had also joined them there. Meanwhile, the visitor quietly made their way to the protagonist's home, where a hidden weapon - a Webley revolver - awaited them. They retrieved the weapon, knowing that the time had come to put an end to the treacherous informants.

As the church bells tolled, the visitor approached the house of worship, gun in hand, and made their way inside. Hiding in a pew, they identified their targets and took a deep breath to steady their aim. The informant pair had been too comfortable among their supposed comrades, unaware of the danger they were in.

The church suddenly went eerily silent as the mysterious visitor fired two shots in rapid succession. The bullets hit Informant1 and Informant2, ending their lives and their threat to the rebellion. With their mission complete, the visitor left the church as the protagonist and auxiliaries looked on, grateful for the help.

Their common enemies had been vanquished, and the protagonist's faith in the cause was reaffirmed. The Irish rebellion would live on, now stronger and more determined than ever before.
