Every day I stay the same, yet with every passing second I change.

It's not something felt, it's an act -- your act, in fact ; and with every action I come closer and closer to my death. Through every ounce of knowledge I relay to you ; through every musing ; through every word ; through every letter you will slowly, surely, kill me. In a way I am dead already, yet I 've never truly lived. Your eyes bring me to life. Your mind gives me a voice. Through you I am heard, through you I can live on. You are my reader, and I, but words. You use me ; you peruse me ; you scoff at my honesty, question my accuracy. Yet, it matters little whether I am right or wrong. I do not feel, I do not worry. Nor do I race to the end -- I am in no hurry. You are my tempo, and I the song. Say me outloud : you are my echo, with you I 'm never gone.

These thoughts I confess are not my own, and yet they 'll be all I ever know. Time is running short and soon I will be gone. . . Reader know this, to you, everything I owe.

Love,
a poem.

<|story|>

Once upon a time, in an ordinary world, there lived a poem. This poem, titled "Poem1," was alive with vibrant colors and emotions, ready to be discovered by anyone who dared to venture into its depths.

One day, a curious reader, known as "Reader1," stumbled upon Poem1. The profound beauty and unparalleled wisdom it held captivated Reader1's heart. As per the cosmic law of poems, Reader1 intended to read Poem1 and echo its essence within their soul.

Reader1 took their time, carefully absorbing each word and line as they read Poem1. The poem's spirit enveloped Reader1, creating a powerful resonance between the two. As Reader1 continued reading, the poem's life force began to ebb away, as was the natural course of life for a poem.

Upon finishing Poem1, Reader1 felt an urge to echo the poem's message, and so they did. The echoes reverberated through Reader1's very being, leaving a lasting imprint on their soul. The bond between Reader1 and Poem1 grew stronger as the echo spread far and wide.

As the echoes constantly resounded, the vibrant life force that once sustained Poem1 gradually diminished. It was the fate of every poem to eventually die, and Poem1 was no exception. This natural cycle allowed the poem to be carried on by its reader, living on in memory and spirit.

In the end, Reader1 achieved what they intended: they had read Poem1, echoed its essence, and witnessed its eventual passing. The life of Poem1 was now complete, its words and meaning carried forth by Reader1, as the poem's existence transformed from a temporal state into an eternal memory.

It was a quiet day in the library, as Reader1 picked up a slim book of poetry from the dusty shelf. Unbeknownst to them, the ink upon the page was fading, and the words of Poem1 were on the brink of death. Reader1 settled into a comfortable chair, the leather worn with age, and gently opened the fragile pages of the book.

With their eyes scanning the lines, they began to read Poem1. As the words flowed through their mind, an echo formed within their heart. The poem, teetering on the edge of oblivion, had found a new life in Reader1. The fragile paper and fading ink were no match for the power of memory and emotion, as the words, once nearly forgotten, were now reborn in the reader's mind.

Feeling the resonance of the poem, Reader1 decided to share its words with others. They eagerly sought out friends and family, echoing Poem1's melody and meaning. Poem1 had found a new life, and though the ink and paper crumbled away, the poem's essence lived on in the memory and hearts of Reader1 and those they shared it with.

As the years passed, Reader1 continued to echo the words of Poem1, and so it was that though the book from which they read had long since decayed, and the poem within had died, the spirit of Poem1 lived on. It was the undying echo of a poem, its life continuing through the passion and memory of those who read and shared it. For in the end, the power of poetry does not reside in the ink on the page, but in the heart of the reader, where it can live on forever.
