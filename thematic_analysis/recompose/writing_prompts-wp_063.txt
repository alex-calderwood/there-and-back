We did it. Me and my two friends created a 100 % death calculator. It showed when you would die and why, and most importantly, if it was avoidable. " Let's test it dude ! ", Pat said. He was at it before I couldn't stop him. " Late eighties, cause is age and is unavoidable. ", he said, monotone yet cheerfully. " My turn ! ", said Stephen. He got similar results. I went last.

I put my hand on the scanner. The results printed. They said : " Five minutes from now, cause is mutilation, avoidable if logic is used. Recommended action : lock door now. " " What the fuck? ", I said. " Uhh. . I probably screwed some code up. ", Pat said. We sat there for about out four minutes arguing over what to do, arguing over whether to heed the advice, or to ignore it. " Need some food. ", Stephen said, " Lets head down. "

We stepped out of the room and began to head downstairs. We heard a knock on the front door from the top of the stairwell. " Probably my parents. ", I said. They wee out for the day, and just came back. I was excited to tell them that my death calculator actually worked. " Where 'd you 're parents go? ", Pat asked. " They left an hour ago for IKEA. ", I responded. I took a step downstairs. " That was fast. IKEA is far as hell. Took my parents five hours. ", Pat said. That's when it hit me.

IKEA took about five hours to get to from where I live. My parents left and hour ago. All of a sudden, they 're back?

" Stop. ", I said. " Remember the death calculator? ", I said. I didn't have to finish, we put two and two together fast. We charged back to my room and bolted the door shut. " Calm down, no need to stomp. ", Stephen said. " We 're safe, I think. You know, the whole logic thing and how to avoid it? ", he said, panting. " Point made, but what stomping. . . " " What the hell is that? ", I asked. We all heard an extremely loud stomping sound coming from downstairs. Whoever it was, was stomping extremely fast. Too fast. Humans didn't stomp that fast. Suddenly, it stopped. " What the fuck? What do we do? ", I said. Stephen was about to say something when I hear four loud knocks on the room door. I was pumping adrenaline after what I heard next. In an inhuman voice, whatever the fuck on the other side of the door said, " Cmon, open the door. Let's play. I can't come in unless you unlock it. " The voice was not human.

We stood there, contemplating on what to do. " The calculator said to use logic, so we shouldn't open the door under any circumstances. ", Pat said. " Now what? ", I 'm not setting here with whatever the fuck that thing is. ", I said. " Well, it would technically make sense to call 911. ", Stephen said. Pat's phone was charged, he immediately dialed the number. As he was about to hit call, we started hearing breathing on the other side of the door. Then, three loud knocks. Then, screaming : " LET ME IN ! LET ME IN ! ". Then in a calm voice : " Let me in. ". It alternated between calm and loud voices. " Do not fucking go near that door. ", Pat said, " The cops are coming. "

We heard more knocks, but this time, from downstairs. We heard the sound of braking wood. " Calvary is here ! ", I said. " Wait till they get here. ", Stephen said. We heard there knocks on our door. " Police, open up. ", I opened it.

We stepped out. No creature. But we did find scratch marks all over the house, along with visible footsteps on the carpet. It didn't have toes, it looked like, paws.

Police never found any evidence of whatever entered my home. We tried the death calculator again, it said : death averted ; new results : " time until death is 7 days, cause is multiplication, avoidable if weapons used. Recommended action : follow directions of military officer. " Just then, a man wearing army fatigues came in to my room and said, " You boys will need to follow me, everything will be fine, just stay calm. "

In a small, remote building, three friends - the protagonist, Pat, and Stephen - huddled together in Room1, terrified. They had heard whispers of a deadly curse looming over the place, and they were desperate to avoid meeting their untimely ends. 

Out of sheer panic, they decided to lock the door to Room1, believing they could keep the threat at bay. They locked it with haste but realized that they would be trapped inside without any definitive way out. The protagonist, not willing to give up without a fight, decided to be more proactive. 

Refusing to simply wait in fear, the protagonist called the police, who responded promptly. The authorities sent a seasoned military officer to investigate the bizarre situation. The officer arrived on the scene and took charge, surveying the building and finally reaching Room2.

With hope and determination burning in their hearts, the protagonist, Pat, and Stephen chose to follow the officer's every move. They hoped that sticking close to the officer would be their best chance at survival, as he was well-equipped and skilled in handling threats.

The group, now led by the officer, navigated through the building, taking all necessary precautions. They dodged potential dangers, made use of every possible escape route, and fought off any looming threats. In the end, their diligence and the officer's expertise paid off, allowing them to avert their deaths and escape the cursed building.

The three friends were relieved and grateful, having survived the ordeal by trusting in the officer and their own determination. They vowed never again to venture into such a dangerous situation, but they also understood the importance of never giving up and working together in the face of adversity.

<|story|>

In a world where every individual's death was inexorably predetermined, the only hope of survival was to avert the seemingly unavoidable fate. Three friends, the protagonist, Pat, and Stephen, were fully aware of their impending doom, therefore, they decided to join forces and help each other escape the clutches of death.

The protagonist, the daring one among the three, went ahead and formulated a plan to call the police for assistance. They believed that if the military officer were to arrive on the scene, they would have a better chance of changing their grim futures. Pat, the quickest thinker of the group, took the initiative and called the police. As he desperately explained the situation, an officer was dispatched to their location.

While waiting for the military officer to arrive, Pat decided to follow the protagonist, believing that their combined strength would help them overcome any obstacles. Little did they know, the officer, sensing their distress, went to room2 adjacent to their location.

Stephen, the most cautious of the three, decided to follow the protagonist as well, hoping that by staying together, they could all avert their impending demise. Realizing that every second counted, Stephen quickly called the police, requesting backup to ensure their survival. At that moment, they were all determined to escape their looming fate.

The officer heard the calls for help and swiftly arrived at the scene. Pat was the first to avert his death, feeling a sudden and inexplicable surge of relief. Stephen, heart racing, averted his death shortly after. Finally, the protagonist, the mastermind behind the plan, followed the military officer and averted their own death.

The three friends, united and strengthened by their life-altering experiences, embraced the course of action they took. They were grateful for their newfound appreciation of life and the unbreakable bond they formed. The world's oppressive grip failed to triumph over their determination, and they emerged victorious against the inescapable claws of fate.
