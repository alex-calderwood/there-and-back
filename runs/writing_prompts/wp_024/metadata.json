Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

He was a pretty big guy and, judging by the smirk on his face, was as aware as I that I wasn't going to win any fight against him.\n\n* \" Mornin ' \" *. There was a drawl there, intentionally placed to provoke me.\n\n* \" Morning, Karl. What do you want? \" *\n\nI knew what he wanted, of course. I 'd crossed him ; that had been a mistake. Not my first. Thankfully, given my intentionally ridiculous Event choice all those years ago, it wouldn't be my last. No matter how this played out. And I had a sneaking suspicion I knew how this was going to play out.\n\n* \" So, you took something. Was n't yours. And you took it from me. Man, that was stupid. A stupid, stupid shame. I liked you, kid. Had promise. \" *\n\nI grinned ; a quick, fleeting twitch of the facial muscles that didn't reach any other part of my body. I was cold, standing here, and there was a rising panic within me I couldn't quite place. I 'd just come back. Why was I so worried? There was something about him, though. Something about his stance. And I could hear something behind me. A metallic sound, like someone moving a large mass of steel, and scraping it against the floor.\n\nKarl grinned back ; a much more sincere affair then mine : * \" Technology is amazin ', ai n't it? The things we can learn to do. \" *\n\nI heard the scraping sound getting closer. Definitely something heavy. I could just about hear the ragged breathing of whoever was dragging it. There was something else, too. A sort of shuffling sound, muffled. . .\n\n* \" I mean, we cure all kinds of disease. Every day. Amazin ' stuff. Smart people all 'round the world, no? \" *\n\nThis made no sense to me. I tensed up, expecting a fight. Assuming he was throwing me off my guard, off my game. Karl didn't so much as bat an eyelid. Just stood there. Watching me, sizing me up. He just kept speaking, in that maddeningly relaxed fashion. As though he was chatting about the weather, or the sport scores. . .\n\n* \" It was only a matter of time, really. Someone was goin ' to figure it out. Figure out how it worked, how to dig deep enough. How to find out. . . \" *. Karl stretched, suddenly, rotating his neck around his shoulders, loosening up. The screech of metal on concrete came to an abrupt stop, right behind me, and a high-pitched squeal sounded.\n\nI turned. Slowly. Something in me snapped, and terror flooded in, and I knew I had to see. Two men - guys I didn't know - were manoeuvring a small kangaroo out of a cage. I took this in quickly, noting the small Santa hat that was clutched by one of the men, and the curiously specific pattern they had shorn out of its fur.\n\n* \" Once we knew, y'see, it was just a matter of preparation. Thing is, though. . . \" *\n\nI spun. Too slowly. I felt the blade sink into my abdomen. One scream, choked off by a gloved hand, and I didn't feel much of anything. As my vision blurred, I saw Karl peering down at me, a strange look on his face.\n\n* \" Thing is, I feel it kinda makes a mockery of the whole thin ', y'know? Does n't feel so spiritual anymore. \" *\n\nAs the cold air hissed over my lip, forcing its way into my lungs for what I knew was the last time, I saw Karl motion to the men. My last sight was of that Kangaroo. Dressed in a santa hat. Staring quizzically down at me. Was a stupid fucking choice, I thought. Had to make everything a joke. Had to have the last laugh. . .\n\nMy final sight was of the high contrast between the Kangaroo's shorn skin and the dark, luxurious fur. I smiled despite myself. I was such a jackass.\n\n\" LOL \", it read, gleaming against the beast's dark coat, and the burgeoning darkness that swept me up. Then all was silent."
