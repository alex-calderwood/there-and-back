They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

The air was very cool and crisp, the sky lit only by the pale moonlight. It was absolutely breathtaking.\n\n\nI could feel the cool air rush along every hair on my arm, the gravel felt amazing under thin, worn out sneakers. I had been training on this same route for the last 5 weeks.\n\n\nI woke up from a dream, that night that I first started running. I had been putzing around with running for years now. But that dream, left me determined. In the dream, I was in a cloud of white smoke. It was cool, just like the air tonight, and my legs felt just as they do now too. Strong and lean. In fact, my entire body felt strong and lean. The dream left me feeling as though I was literally chasing my dreams, taking advantage of the life that I had. Something good was going to come my way, I could just feel it.\n\n\nTonight I was what felt like 5 minutes into the run, when i reached my turn around point. It was at a small tree, in the middle of this barren field of gravel and weeds. The branches were bare, but looked gorgeous under the moonlight. I stopped to admire the beauty, as my breath turned into white vapor as it left my mouth. I took one step closer towards the tree, my foot crunching the snow that lay beneath. I had n't seen that before, but the sound was comforting.\n\nI ran my fingertips along the trunk of the tree, which was cold and wet from the snow, just to see that it was real. Just to see confirm that I had made it there tonight.\n\nI turned around, and set off my run back. I could hear howling behind me, as a white smoke started to swirl around me. It felt strange, but good. It pushed me more. As I ran, I felt myself getting lighter and lighter. I could hear footsteps running along either side of me. I looked to my left and right. There are wolves running along side me. I didn't know what was going on, I felt a little frightened, but kept going as the white cloud pulled me along. I finally stopped myself, This felt insane.\n\nI twirled around as the cloud of smoke disappeared, the wild animals on either side of me take off to my left. I 'm in the middle of the gravel field completely alone, as I remember : I was bit by a werewolf years ago. My eyes dart straight to full moon that was just uncovered by the clouds, and then too the ground in a panic. I see the sneakers I 'm leaving behind. . . . as my own thoughts fade and I feel myself drift along to follow the pack. . . . ."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
