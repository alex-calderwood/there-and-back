" AUGH ! Sonuva- "

James wasted no time in grabbing his rifle and opening the front door. At the side of the house was a man wearing a blue uniform with a red-and-white nametag. Paul.

He stayed a safe distance. At least ten feet. Not that Paul was going anywhere.

" Who are you? What are you doing here? "

" Do n't shoot, don't ! " The man cowered behind his bloodstained hands. " Do you live here? Please, can you get me out of this bear trap? "

" Answer my question. "

He sobbed, trying to wipe away tears and smearing blood on his face and shirt. " Look, I 'm just here to check the gas meter ! "

" *No one touches that gas meter without my say so ! * I have called that company *seven times ! * " James ' hands shake with rage. " Has *ANYONE* in that company seen Highway Man 3? "

" I can't die here ! I can't die, I can't die. . . " He rocked around in the fetal position until a new outburst of blood poured from his thigh. " AAAH ! "

" You 've been following me ! "

" What? No. " He did not sound at all convincing. His voice sounded weak. Pathetic.

" You are ! You 're here to kill me ! " James switched his grip on the gun. Paul's breath was fading, and his eyes began to flutter. But Jason was not going to let him have the satisfaction of dying. Not yet.

It took some time to drag Paul around to the cellar door, and even longer to take him down the stairs to his workstation. James put a tourniquet on his leg to stop the bleeding. Then he tied Paul up and waited.

Paul awoke, immediately straining against the ropes. James noticed, and picked up a rusted handsaw.

" What kind of killer are you? "

" What? "

" Why are you after me? Is it demons? Or are you just some sick, twisted monster? "

" Please. Let me go. I have a family. I have kids. "

" It does n't matter. " James ripped the saw through Paul's elbow, and he screamed in pain. " You 're a killer. You 're getting what you deserve. "

I watched the entire ordeal through the small window at the base of the house, which peeked into the cellar. He never saw me. It was easy to check the spot for traps now that I knew what I was looking for.

The scene unnerved me. It wasn't right. James was not supposed to kill people. I was supposed to kill James.

He 'll be more alert now. Paranoid, yet vigilant.

This will not be fun at all.
