Harry Feldman was a simple cosmic trucker who dreamed of someday leaving the confining boundaries of Earth behind and venturing into the great unknown. Not just any unknown, mind you; Harry wanted to explore the great and legendary Interspace-76. But the City-Critters, a group of local controllers, held Harry back with their rules and regulations.

One day, Harry finally had enough. He decided it was time to embrace freedom and leave Earth behind. Harry hopped into his prized possession, the Intergalactic Truck, and revved up the engine. As the powerful machine roared to life, Harry started driving. He knew just the ticket to put him in the right mood for breaking free: listening to his favorite band, Skynyrd. The music filled his ears, fueling his resolve to follow his dreams.

The City-Critters, ever vigilant, quickly picked up on Harry's escape. They did not want Harry to become a freedom-lover, venturing out to uncharted territories like Interspace-76. But they underestimated Harry's determination, and their efforts to thwart him fell flat.

Braving the vastness of space, Harry sang along to Skynyrd, feeling the irresistible pull of freedom coursing through his veins. He became a bona fide freedom-lover, his dreams finally realized. The open space and endless possibilities before him were intoxicating.

After a life-changing journey, Harry Feldman arrived at Interspace-76, driving his trusty Intergalactic Truck and still listening to Skynyrd. Leaving the grip of the City-Critters far behind, Harry reveled in the newfound freedom he found among the stars.
