Once there was a man named Mortimer who lived an ordinary life. He had the same routine every dayâ€”so plain, in fact, that he would often fail to notice the surreal events that occurred in his life.

One day, Mortimer was at home lying in bed, fast asleep, when he was awoken by the sound of trumpeting from an elephant who happened to be wearing pajamas. He rubbed his tired eyes and thought, "Is this real, or just a dream?" But he decided to carry on with his day.

As Mortimer got out of bed and stepped onto the floor, he saw Mr. Crawinski, a peculiar man from down the street, holding a lightbulb and walking in a counter-clockwise circle in the middle of his bedroom. Here too, Mortimer was puzzled. "What an odd thing," he thought, "but I better get dressed and start my day."

After getting dressed, Mortimer decided to venture outside, where he encountered a young man with a dog that seemed to have a taste for human ankles. The young man, trying desperately to control his biting dog, shouted, "I'm so sorry! I have no idea why he's acting like this today!"

At that moment, Mortimer suddenly realized the sheer absurdity of his life. He stood in a state of awakening, surrounded by such bizarre events, and thought to himself, "My life is a joke!" From then on, Mortimer embraced the peculiar happenings, and learned to enjoy the constant surprises.
