Once upon a time, there were two noble dogs named Ori and Boo, guardians of an ancient oath. They had a sacred duty to bring their master to a mystical place called the Herenow. The Herenow was a magical space and time, where the master experienced great peace and presence.

The master had grown busy and distracted, often missing those magical moments in the Herenow. Ori and Boo watched from a distance, saddened, as their master's life seemed to pass by without experiencing the true beauty and wonder of living in the present moment.

One day, Ori glanced at Boo, and wordlessly, they both knew it was time to remind their master of the ancient oath. As the guardians, it was their duty to help the master in need.

Ori went to the master and gave a gentle reminder about the ancient oath. The master nodded, noticing the concern in Ori's eyes. The master understood the forgotten duty, and the need for a walk, to return to the Herenow.

As they walked, the master felt the worries and distractions fade away, replaced by the joy of the present moment. Ori, the loyal guardian, watched over the master with love.

It was then that the moment they had been waiting for arrived: the Time of Passing. The master, now connected to the present, was ready for whatever may come with grace and acceptance.

With Ori by the master's side, the Time of Passing occurred, and the master moved forward with newfound wisdom, forever grateful for the guardianship of Ori and Boo, the noble dogs who had kept the ancient oath alive.
