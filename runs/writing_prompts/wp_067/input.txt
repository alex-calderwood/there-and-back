I stared. This could not be happening right now.

The figure in front of me came at me steadily, taking its time. It's movements were almost mesmerizing, a sort of drunken swaying coupled with a stumble forward.

It was a frightening thing to look at, objectively speaking. It had too many arms, all ending in nasty looking claws. Its torso was a mottled red-and-black, as if all the skin had burned off and I was seeing just the scorched flesh underneath. Little pustules all over the hellish landscape of its body oozed yellow and green.

But it was the face that froze me.

I closed my eyes and concentrated. I could feel the dreamscape changing, bending to my will. I had done this a million times before, using my almost godly powers to save myself from all sorts of dire situations. I 've defeated the worst of monsters with a simple thought and enjoyed the rest of the dream however I wished.

I opened my eyes again. The world looked a lot brighter and more cheerful ; the monster was trapped in a transparent box made of an impenetrable material. It would never be able to reach me. Only I could free it.

" Why, darling? Do n't you love me? "

I cringed and looked on at this monster, this creature with a nightmarish body and my late wife's face. Tears streamed from eyes without pupils and the words came out of a mouth that did not move ; after all, it was frozen in the same shape I had seen on her when I found her hanging from the ceiling fan, feet dangling.

" I just want to hold you, my love. . . "

Every night for the past month, she showed up. Without fail, I would find her in some aspect of my dream. A woman at a coffee shop, in the submarine with me at the bottom of the ocean, as a monster out to get me.

Always with her death-expression grafted onto her face.

My dreams alone could kill me, but I had become too clever to let that happen. My control over my mind was total and complete.

Except for her face.

How long will I keep seeing her? What happens if I see her again tomorrow night, next week, next year, next century? Will I be seeing her dead face for the rest of my immortal life?

Eternity is a long time for that sort of torture. Not for the first time, i considered letting the monster leave its cage and do what it would to me.

A whimpering sound came from her lips. I turned away. I wanted to run, but I knew it was pointless. Her face would follow me to the coldest reaches of my mind.

" Do n't you miss me, honey? I miss you. . . "
