Andrew was a sensitive young man who easily felt pain, both physical and emotional. He was also different from others in a very special way - he had a rare transformative power that turned him into a crow. He felt destined to unlock this power, although he hadn't yet experienced the transformation.

One sunny morning, Andrew went for a walk in the park. Despite the beautiful weather, his thoughts swirled with sadness and despair. As he walked, he stumbled upon a sharp rock, and the resulting pain shot through his body. The pain, combined with the emotional weight he carried, was the trigger; his intention to use his powers to transform became stronger in that moment.

The sunlight was ample that day, providing the perfect conditions for his transformation. As the pain rushed through his body and mind, Andrew felt an unfamiliar sensation, as if his body was giving way to something new. His senses sharpened and his physique changed dramatically; his arms turned into black wings, and he felt the urge to take flight. He had successfully transformed into a crow.

The world appeared different from the sky, and Andrew had a newfound perspective. He embraced the freedom of his transformation, knowing that even though his human pain had subsided, the experience had changed him profoundly.
