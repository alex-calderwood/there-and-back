Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

His teeth stung as he sucked air down into his lungs and almost unconsciously he dug his fingers into his thigh until it was no more.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, *thighs*.\n\nIt was almost a miracle he had survived thus far -- one person could only stay hidden for so long. The windows were his biggest contender, what with every human's need for vitamin D and his particular affinity for basking in the warm daylight.\n\nDazed, he glanced up at the window and one corner of his mouth twitched as he spotted a crow perched on the delapidated tree planted purposefully right outside his wall.\n\nApollo was always right. The crow shrieked. One lone black wing sank to the grass.\n\nWith a whoosh, feathers pierced through his darkening skin and erupted into ruffled plumage. For a brief moment he choked and then he found himself perched upon the ground, wings spread and beak parted.\n\nFreedom could only ever be found in others -- an ironic twist in the land of the free -- and for now, Andrew sought it out in the pain of that which was foolish enough to find his window to the world. This was left for the human mind though, the very mind which was now buried deep beneath the crow's. The crow sought the sun, and the sun it would have.\n\nUpon landing, he folded his wings and preened. His claws clicked idly on the mahogany desk, leaving tiny prints in the manila envelopes and white cardstock that littered the surface. The countdown began.\n\nThe sun warmed his feathers. His beady eyes focused on the ants that paraded through a crack in the wall. A flash of light danced around the room for a brief second. The countdown ended.\n\nAs quickly as it came, it left, and the crow mind vanished as the feathers retreated back into the ashen skin from which they came.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, *waist*.\n\nH groaned, choking on the pain that inched up his spine and threaded its way through his skull. This was it, his last moments, and he couldn't even get off his desk.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, *chest*.\n\nSuddenly breathing was impossible and as the last shreds of consciousness crawled their way out of his skull, Andrew slammed his hand onto the desk.\n\n\" Mr. President? \" The woman stood at the entrance to the room, a closed fist to her chest. Her frown slowly raised and with one step she was within the room.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, chest.

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan is a list of character actions and story events that was generated from the domain and problem. It expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true:\n    (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate)\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a one-page natural language story in an engaging style using the provided domain, problem, and plan as a guide. All of the events in the plan must be present in your story in the correct order.\n\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with the provided story plan. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story, and the plan as the chronological ordering of events. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis.

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan can be generated from the domain and problem, and expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints. You won't have access to the plan, but should generate stories that adhere to a plan that could be generated from the constraints of the domain and problem.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with a hypothetical story plan produced by the domain and problem. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."
