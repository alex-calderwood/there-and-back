They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

It had been six months of bloodshed, hatred and anger. When it all began, the army would crush the rebels but each defeat only fuled their cause and soon, they had an army of their own, nobility had begun supporting their cause, providing weapons, trained men and supplies and as the war raged on, more nobels allied with the rebellion. The capital city had fallen three days ago, when the gatemen revealed who's side they had taken. Once inside the walls of the city, the rebels found support from all within : peasants rejoyced, merchants welcomed them, soldiers salluted them and the King's Knights, his own personal guard, knelt before the rebel army, with only one man remaining by the King and his family. After that, it was only a matter of time before the castle fell into their hands and the king was slain in his throne room ; he was not given the dignity of a formal execution, his family however, were. The queen had been executed on the first day of the new regeim, the Prince and his newly-wed bride on the second and now, finally, on the third day it was the turn of the Princess and the one Knight. As the Princess made her way to the gallows, a fate that her father had sentenced so many to, her Knight began to shield her from the mob. \" DEATH ! ! \" the crowd began to roar and as missiles began to fly, her Knight raised his cloak and shield to protect her from the barrage. She didn't even know the man's name and he was shielding her, when he could have better protected himself. When they reached the gallows, two more knights approached him and dragged him away, he knew his fate as did the Princess, now at the foot of the Gallows, resigned to her fate."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
