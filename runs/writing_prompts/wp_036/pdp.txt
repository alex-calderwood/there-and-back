In a world where light was a scarce resource, people crafted lightboxes to harness the power of light. The protagonist, a skilled lightbox maker, decided to create three lightboxes for his personal use.

One day, the protagonist began by working on the second lightbox. He carefully assembled its components and put them together, bringing the lightbox to life. With the creation complete and the lightbox in his possession, he proceeded to anchor it securely. He then charged the lightbox with the energy necessary to unleash its light. Finally, the protagonist used the lightbox, illuminating his surroundings with the powerful light it emitted. It was a sight to behold. The second lightbox's purpose was served, and the protagonist felt accomplished.

With his growing experience, the protagonist moved on to craft the third lightbox. He repeated the process, creating the lightbox with expert precision. Anchoring the lightbox and charging it with energy, he prepared it for use. The protagonist used the third lightbox, and it filled the room with light, leaving a sense of warmth and comfort. He was excited to witness the effectiveness of his creations.

The protagonist's final task was to create the first lightbox. Drawing on his experience from crafting the second and third lightboxes, he quickly finished making the first lightbox. Once again, he anchored it and charged it with energy, ready to be used. The protagonist used the first lightbox with a sense of achievement, as it emitted the light just as the others had done before.

Throughout this journey, the protagonist successfully created, anchored, charged, and used the three lightboxes. The sense of accomplishment filled him as he completed the goal he set out to achieve. His world now had a constant source of light, and the protagonist's life changed for the better, as he harnessed the true power of light.
