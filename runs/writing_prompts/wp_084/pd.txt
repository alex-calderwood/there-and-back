Once upon a time in a small town, there lived two people named Protagonist and Love Interest. The two of them had known each other for a long time, and over the years, Protagonist developed deep feelings for Love Interest. But Protagonist was too shy to confess these feelings.

One day, Love Interest decided to ask Protagonist if they loved them. Protagonist, caught off guard, was unsure how to respond. They knew they needed to confess their love, but the fear of rejection still loomed over them.

In their desperation, Protagonist heard about a magical pill that would give whoever took it the courage to reveal their true feelings. They decided to take a chance and sought out the pill in hopes of finding the confidence they needed.

Protagonist finally found the pill and, without hesitation, took it. Slowly but surely, they felt the courage building up inside them. With their newfound bravery, Protagonist was finally ready to confess their love to Love Interest.

The moment came when Love Interest approached Protagonist once more to ask the same question: "Do you love me?" This time, Protagonist looked Love Interest in the eye and said, "Yes, I love you." The confession filled the air, and Protagonist felt a sense of relief wash over them.

Love Interest, blushing, smiled at Protagonist. The two of them had finally revealed their true feelings, and their bond grew stronger as a result. And so, the story of Protagonist and Love Interest continued, with a deeper understanding and love for one another.
