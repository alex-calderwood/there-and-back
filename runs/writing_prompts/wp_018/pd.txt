The old Grim Reaper, a timeless figure of mythology, had grown weary. He knew that it was time to pass on the mantle to someone else, someone capable and up to the task. The Reaper started searching for a suitable candidate when finally, he came across a rather unexpected choice – a recently deceased soul by the name of Protagonist.

This protagonist, hailing from the mortal realm, was full of untapped potential. Initially, it seemed like a strange fit, but the old Reaper sensed that the protagonist held the right qualities. He knew that he could no longer carry on the responsibility, and so, he decided to set a plan in motion.

The old Reaper communicated his intention to retire to the protagonist, who, despite his initially surprised reaction, accepted the role. But before the protagonist could inherit the duties, he had to receive the symbolic items of the Reaper – the scythe and the robe.

As they stood within the ethereal plane, the old Reaper handed over the iconic scythe and robe to the protagonist. The moment the protagonist donned the robe and held the scythe firmly in his hand, he could feel the ancient energy of the Reaper flowing through him. The old Reaper smiled, knowing that the protagonist had indeed been the right choice.

Now carrying the weight of his new role, the protagonist became the new Grim Reaper. His responsibilities would include collecting souls when their time came, ensuring the balance between life and death remained undisturbed. As the old Reaper stepped down from his position, he retired with a sense of relief, watching the protagonist take his place.

The old Reaper's legacy would continue through the protagonist, who would guide the departed souls and uphold the cosmic order. With the scythe and robe, the protagonist began his new eternal journey, fully embracing his role as the Grim Reaper.
