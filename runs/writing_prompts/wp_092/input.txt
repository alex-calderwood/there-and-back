" Come along, girls ! " Diana called from down the hall. Her two eldest daughters, twins of identical beauty, were sixteen this year and would finally be allowed to take lovers. They had spent the last several weeks learning about, trying on, and playing with various paints, perfumes, and dyes to look their best. Now since ablutions they had not come out of their chambers, refusing until they looked perfect.

" Let them make themselves as beautiful as they desire, " Diana mother, Artemia, said, coming out of another room with her grandson in her arms. He was clothed in gentle cloth for the day was hot, and there would be traveling for several hours. " They may have flirted and exchanged blushing comments last year with the young men, but it is another thing entirely to go to their beds. "

" I know. But it is silly to make yourself perfect now, before we travel. " Of course that was something you learned because it happened to you, not because your mother said so.

Diana took her son from her mother with a sad smile, trying to keep from falling into anguish again. She had managed to remain cheerful until now, not giving too much thought to the time ahead. Her daughters were women, and her son. . . In four days they would be back in their women's city and her son would no longer be in her arms. At barely three months he still needed his mother's touch and milk, but as a man he could not stay any longer than the time between birth and the yearly Meeting. She wanted to keep him, hold him for at least another year. . if he went now he might die. But that was why they were separated, or so legends said. Women were sentimental in a way men were not. She had carried and bore her son, while his father had only known his own pleasure a year past. He might not even take the boy into his home when they met again. There would be no choice other than to lay her precious child at the gates and leave, praying with every breath that someone would open their doors and take in the child. . she had seen it happen, once as a younger girl. A woman leaving her son, the cries throughout the day that reached their caravan. . . the cries that did not stop after the men left for their own home. The cries of the mother after the cries of her child had finally stopped.

" Perhaps if we say I and he are ill, and can not travel? "

" You can not. " Artemia stroked Agapios's cheek and then hugged her daughter tightly. " The gods would know you lie, and there would be punishment brought down upon us. "

" What if he is not accepted? "

" Sh. He was your lover, do you distrust yourself so much? This is a happy time. Your daughters are women, you may find yourself a grandmother soon as well. You told me he was kind and dear. You will spend the two days with him, speaking about your son, and being a family. "

She nodded, sniffling and wiping away tears. " You are right, mother, of course. Such a heartless act has not happened in years. "

" Mother ! "

" Mama ! "

Her two daughters finally dashed down the hall to them, one with her sandals and the other with bare feet. Their make-up was a little heavy, and they wore a bit too much scent, but they were smiling and proud of their appearance. After a day of walking the extra would be gone anyway, and she could help reapply moderate amounts.

" You look lovely. " Tears welled in her eyes again but she blinked them back. Silly emotions, she had forgotten how strong they were during and soon after a babe. The family took what few things they would needed to bring, gave thanks to the gods, and began their journey to see the men.

Really fun premise, OP. I might take it and work it into a book, if that's alright. I write fantasy stories in a large world ranging from ancient to Victorian, and this could go well with my 'Ancient Greek ' section of the world.
