Peter sat on the beach alone, his knees pulled to his chest, his thin arms wrapped around them. He watched the waves roll in, sparkling blue except for the white bubbling crest at the top, sending tiny crabs skittering away as they washed up onto the sandy shore. Neverland was a beautiful place, but it felt as if it were a prison.

Peter often sat in the same precise spot, he couldn't remember the last evening he had n't been there. Straight ahead, a ways beyond where the waves broke and the sea was more still, just gently rolling was half of Hook's ship, broken and haggard looking, the bow thrusting up from the sea. The ship was covered in green moss, and barnacles clung to the rotten wood. Hook was long dead, and Peter had n't seen another pirate in years.

Peter sat thinking about the fights he and old Hook had had. Man, it had been a great time for some stretch of years. The lunging, the thrusts, the swords clanking together, the trusty dagger Peter kept at his waist. Then came Wendy, and her annoying little brothers, and with their help, Peter had put an end to Hook for good, though he knew in his heart he had n't really wanted to. It was all a game, a game so fun they played it every day for decades. But then Hook had died, and the rest of the pirates moved off, and Peter was okay at first because he had Wendy. But then she had went home, and had n't come back. And she took the Lost Boys with her. Then for a long time it was just Peter. Peter and the savages, but now they were all gone too, claimed by some mysterious illness that had swept through their tribe. Peter remained healthy.

In the years since Peter had gotten some kids to come to Neverland, and it was fun, but never the same. They would swoop through the air, hollering with joy. But there were no pirates to fight, no adventures to be had, so the children would bore easily and leave, leaving Peter alone once more. He had Tinkerbell of course, for some time, but she too was gone now, along with all of the other fairies, because there simply had n't been enough people to believe.

Now Peter couldn't even get kids to come with him. The world was so different now. Not Neverland, but the place beyond, through the sky, past the stars. Children were too attached to these strange electronic boxes, they had everything they could want, there was no imagination. Everything could be given to you for real, you didn't need to pretend. Peter was still a child, and he felt as if he were the last child, even when there was a place full of them.

So Peter came to the beach each night and stared at what remained of Hooks ship without really seeing it. The waves broke on the beach and the sun fell through the blue sky, turning it orange and purple before it all faded to black.
