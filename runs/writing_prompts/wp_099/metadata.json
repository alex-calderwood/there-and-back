Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile.

Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan is a list of character actions and story events that was generated from the domain and problem. It expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true:\n    (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate)\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a one-page natural language story in an engaging style using the provided domain, problem, and plan as a guide. All of the events in the plan must be present in your story in the correct order.\n\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with the provided story plan. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story, and the plan as the chronological ordering of events. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan can be generated from the domain and problem, and expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints. You won't have access to the plan, but should generate stories that adhere to a plan that could be generated from the constraints of the domain and problem.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with a hypothetical story plan produced by the domain and problem. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."
