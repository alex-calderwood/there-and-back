Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

I can imagine you -- looking beautiful, an intelligent young woman with your whole life ahead of you. You know that I love you very much, and that I know you will be successful in whatever you do. I hope your dad gives you some sort of fatherly advice today, something more profound that ' stay away from boys, they ' re still up to no good. '\nMy beautiful, lovely, intelligent daughter : Happy 18th Birthday. I wish I was there.\nLove Always,\nMom \"\n\n\nJen re-read the birthday card she opened on her 18th birthday. To date, that had been her favourite one. It was creased and yellowed on the inside now, corners worn from her resting it on the rim of her vanity mirror. The once-vibrant red cover, now faded with most of its lemon-yellow glitter worn off, boasted a big \" 18 \" in the middle, with rainbow block letters below that read \" you ' ve got your whole life ahead of you ! \"\n\n\nIt was the sweetest gift that Jen ' s mom could have given her -- greeting cards for every birthday, every graduation, every significant moment in her life -- written before her mom passed away from cancer 23 years ago. Jen was just four years old.\n\n\nWhen she was younger, her father would give Jen a card one at a time, fearful that she wouldn ' t be able to resist opening them all at once, but on her 18th birthday, he passed on the entire box of all the letters to her.\n\n\nIt was a light birch colour, about the size of a shoebox. The small bronze latch squeaked a bit when you opened it, and you always had to be careful as one of the hinges lost its metal tine that keeps it together.\n\n\nIt turns out that you need a pretty big vessel for a lifetime of milestones. Maybe that was why her 18th birthday card stood out as the most special -- it was the time, in some way, that she could be closest to her mother with a life ' s worth of messages all within her grasp.\n\n\nThe temptation was pretty great in the beginning to tear at each coloured envelope and read every one. She got pretty close on particular evening after a whole bottle of pinot and a too-light dinner. To this day, Jen is thankful she didn ' t do that. To consume them all in one fell swoop would have spoiled it, and she would never have a new note to read from her mother again.\n\n\nIt was part of why birthdays were so special -- a new message from the mother that she barely remembers. Her mom thought of it all -- graduation, first breakup, buying a house, going to university, having a child, getting engaged -- Jen was often astounded just how many milestones a person experiences in their lifetime.\n\n\nUnfortunately, today was a milestone that she didn ' t have a card for. It seemed that her mother had thought of everything, but who could have predicted this?\n\n\nI guess sometimes people don ' t like to plan for the worst, and just hope for the best. She figured re-reading the 18th birthday card again might give her strength for where she had to go today.\n\n\nSticking the card back onto her vanity between the wooden trim and mirror, she took a deep breath.\n\n\nWalking into the hospital for her first chemotherapy treatment, she wished she had the strength that her mother had while facing the same disease. Today certainly was a milestone, a first, and in a way, she did have her whole life ahead of her. It just seems that it wouldn ' t last very long."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
