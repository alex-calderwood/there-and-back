Hey guys, how's it going.

Light-hearted comments aside, have you ever considered amending the [ PI ] tag's rules? More specifically the second bullet point. Because in the case of my series, it becomes a question of which prompt inspired it. Obviously I can not link every single prompt that has inspired a series, but at the same time the very first prompt that did so often has very little in common with the most recent plot or characters. Would it be possible to adjust or forgo this requirement? Perhaps create a new tag like [ CS ] Continued Story?

That away, what's your favorite flavor of ice cream? Mackinac Island Fudge perhaps?
