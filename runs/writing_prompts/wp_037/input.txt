She looked at me with doe eyes hidden behind thick half moons perched on her broad nose. A smile erupted from her lips as she said my name. I had n't found her, she had found me. I fell for her instantly. For two years we did puzzles together, went on adventures, played board games, and wrote post cards. She seemed to love post cards almost as much as I did. Two years goes by quickly when you 're having fun. It all seemed like one magnificent blur. One morning when I woke up she was gone. I hunted high and low for any sign of her. Just as I had given up hope, a drumming knock came from the door.

" Hello ! " I said, opening the door without waiting for a reply. " Oh, I-um- "

" Hi ! You must be Wally ! " she exclaimed familiarly.

" I 'm sorry, do I know you? " I asked.

" Oh, that's right ! Silly me, " she said, playfully hitting herself atop the head. " I 'm Wenda, Wilma's sister ! We 're twins ! Can you believe it? "

I was speechless. She seemed like my Wilma, but they were not the same. There were so many little things about her from the way she spoke to the way that she smelled that set off alarms in my head. My perturbation must have shown on my face as she slouched and backed away a little. I tried to hide it as I welcomed her into my home. She had found me, it was the least I could do. Finding me wasn't an easy feat. We talked and joked and played, but it wasn't the same. I missed my Wilma and seeing her sister only reminded me more of that fact.

Wenda didn't know that her sister had gone missing, nor did she seem overly concerned. I was trying my best to hold together the broken pieces of the facade that held back the welling flood of distress within me. I would give up everything just to touch her again, to hear her say my name. Though I had my friends and fans, I had never felt so alone. Each night brought memories of our time together until there were no more to explore. In their place, my mind made new recollections. As I searched high and low for her, the past began to muddle in my dreams.

Wenda and I began a relationship soon after. I had n't stopped looking for Wilma and her sister was the only thing I had left of her. I clung to her for support as I shied away from the world. I didn't want them to see me, not like this. They wouldn't understand. I hid my pain behind a thin smile as my tears soaked into the pillowcase at night. More and more people began to search for me, but I didn't want to be found. Why didn't they search for Wilma? She was the one that we—no, I—needed to find. I wanted to know that she was alive, that she knew how I felt somehow. I wanted to spend one last night where I didn't miss her, to have her by my side.
