They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

As I make my way outside into this unknown grassy terrain, I check and double check that my oxygen levels are steady and that the cart of sweets and assorted cakes ( that were asked for in the distress call ) are full. A crackling voice from my headset asks \" Is the cart secure? \". \" roger that \" I responded.\nAccording to my tracker I 'm only a few hundred meters from the distress beacon. I make my way under and over a hill, making my way over the\nhill I gaze upon something I did not expect.\nThere on a lovely, behemoth of a mushroom sat an old, bearded man with a pointy hat. He appeared to be smoking out of a long wooden pipe, beautiful multicolored tendrils of smoke rose from the pipe. He spotted me and his voice bellowed \" Ah young Master Baggins, where ever did you go to? \"\n\" Um. . . we got your distress signal and message sir. You said there were small folk in dire need of cakes and sweets, a matter of life and death if I recall \" I replied. The old man looked me up and down with those blue, glazed eyes and snapped \" It's me, Gandalf ! What armor is this you wear? What happened to your Mithril vest? \" With a wave of his hand my oxygen helmet disappeared and I started to choke but the old man muttered something in a foreign language and I was miraculously able to breathe.\nHe shot up from the mushroom and was beside me in an instant, waving his hands again and muttering I suddenly felt very relaxed and passive. He placed the pipe in my mouth, I looked at the bottom of the pipe it was filled to the brim with a lavender colored looking herb. \" The finest long bottom leaf this side of the South Farthing \" the ancient man whispered excitedly as he produced a flame from his decrepit finger and pointed it at the pipe.\nI inhaled for what felt like an eternity, I exhaled slowly and to my astonishment a bright yellow frigate sailed out from my mouth and exploded into a kaleidoscope of stars and galaxies. I shut my eyes in disbelief, thinking to myself this shit can not be real. I peel my eyes open and surrounding the old man and myself were hundreds of little people wearing various sorts of vests and shorts, all dancing and singing merrily.\n\" You are Master Baggins now \" barked Gandalf as he rested his hand on my shoulder. Without warning, I gradually shrunk down to the size of the little folk, gone was the rest of my space suit and I was now wearing a brown vest with orange shorts.\nI had the sudden urge to dance and dance I did. I strutted my stuff on a dance floor made of hay while a \" disco ball \" that resembled a well known New Zealand film director hovered above us. My stomach roared with a fiery desire for food. Gandalf must have sensed my sudden appetite as he roared for all to hear \" The Mega Munchies have kicked in, let elevenses commence \".\nThe yearning for food was too much for me, I dived on the cart ( my mission long forgotten ) devouring all the delicious cakes I could get my little hands on. I had accepted my fate, I am Master Baggins. . . ."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
