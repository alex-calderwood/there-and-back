Tom and Sue were good friends who loved spending time together. They would often take their adventures to the forest where they would play games, find little treasures, and simply enjoy each other's company. One day, as they were exploring the forest, Tom stumbled upon a unique looking stone. It had a peculiar shape and a mysterious aura that drew Tom in. He had a great idea â€“ he would give the stone to Sue as a surprise gift and make her happy.

As Tom and Sue continued their walk through the forest, Tom carefully pocketed the stone, so Sue wouldn't notice it. He was excited about the whole idea and couldn't wait to see the smile on her face when she discovered his surprise. The forest was filled with chirping birds, rustling leaves, and the laughter of the two friends as they strolled along.

After a while, they decided to take a break and rest for a while on a fallen log. Tom saw this as the perfect opportunity to reveal the gift he found for Sue. He covertly took the stone out of his pocket and said to her, "Sue, I found something interesting that I think you'll really like. Close your eyes!"

Sue was curious but obliged, closing her eyes and waiting for the surprise. Tom carefully placed the pretty stone in her outstretched hands. "You can open your eyes now," he said with anticipation.

When Sue opened her eyes and saw the stone, her face lit up with joy. "Wow! This is such a beautiful stone! Thank you, Tom!" she exclaimed, overjoyed by the gift. Tom, in turn, felt incredibly happy that he made Sue happy with his surprise.

Together, Tom and Sue played around the forest, taking turns admiring the interesting stone, and laughing until they were out of breath. The forest echoed with their happiness, and their bond grew even stronger as they shared the simple, yet meaningful, treasure they found in the forest that day.
