Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a pretty fox. The fox had a long tail. Everyone said the tail was attractive.
One day, the pretty fox was walking in the forest. The fox saw a big tree. The tree had a part where a small animal could hide. The fox wanted to see what was inside.
The fox put its tail in the part of the tree. But, something unexpected happened! The tail was stuck! The fox pulled and pulled, but the tail did not come out. Then, a small mouse came out. The mouse helped the fox get its tail out. The fox was happy and said "thank you" to the mouse. They became best friends.
