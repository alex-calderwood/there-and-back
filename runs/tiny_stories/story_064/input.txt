Anna liked to play with her dolls. She had many dolls, but her favorite was Lily. Lily had long yellow hair, blue eyes and a pink dress. Anna liked to brush Lily's hair and make her talk.
One day, Anna found a big mirror in her mom's room. She wanted to see how Lily looked in the mirror. She carried Lily to the mirror and held her up. She smiled and said, "Look, Lily, you are so pretty! You are the prettiest doll in the world!"
But when Anna looked in the mirror, she saw something that made her scream. She did not see Lily's face, but a face that was ugly and scary. It had green skin, red eyes and sharp teeth. It was a monster!
Anna was so afraid that she dropped Lily and ran away. She did not know that the mirror was a trick mirror. It made everything look ugly and scary. Her mom had bought it for Halloween, but she forgot to put it away.
Lily fell to the floor and broke her arm. She felt sad and hurt. She wished Anna would come back and hug her. She did not understand why Anna was scared of her. She did not know that the mirror was a lie. She said, "Anna, please come back. I am not a monster. I am your doll. I love you."
