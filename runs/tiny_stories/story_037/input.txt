Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a dog named Max. Max loved to run and shake his tail. One day, a cat named Whiskers came to the town. Whiskers was very foolish and liked to play tricks on Max.
Whiskers thought of a plan. He told Max that there was a big bone hidden in the town. Max was very excited and started to shake his tail. Whiskers said, "I will help you find the bone, but you must give me a treat." Max agreed and they went to look for the bone.
They searched and searched, but there was no bone. Max was very sad and gave Whiskers a treat. Whiskers laughed and said, "I tricked you! There is no bone." Max learned that it was foolish to trust Whiskers. The moral of the story is to be careful who you trust and not to be foolish like Max.
