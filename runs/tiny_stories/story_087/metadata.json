                "content": "<|Story|>\n\nThe Nazis, in their holy quest for world domination, were looking for the Ark of the Covenant. They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."
