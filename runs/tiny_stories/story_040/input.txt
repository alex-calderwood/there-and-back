Once upon a time, there was a big mountain. A small boy named Tim lived near the mountain. Tim had a toy he loved very much. One day, the wind took his toy and it went to the top of the mountain.
Tim was scared, but he wanted his toy back. So, he started to walk up the mountain. As he walked, he saw a big bird. The bird saw that Tim was sad and asked, "Why are you sad?" Tim said, "I lost my toy on the mountain." The bird said, "I can help you."
The big bird carried Tim up the mountain. They found the toy and Tim was very happy. The bird carried Tim and his toy back home. They became good friends and played together every day. And Tim was not scared of the mountain anymore.
