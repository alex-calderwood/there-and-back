Once upon a time in a peaceful forest, a clever little ant and a wise old bird were great friends. They were inseparable and always looked out for each other. They loved exploring the forest together and enjoyed the delicious fruits it had to offer.

One day, while wandering through the woods, the ant saw a shiny red apple hanging from a tree. It had never tasted an apple before, and it looked delicious. The ant told the bird how much it wanted to eat the apple.

The bird, being a supportive friend, decided to help the ant. The bird flew up to the tree, grabbed the apple with its beak, and gently dropped it on the ground. The ant excitedly approached the apple, ready to have a feast.

However, there was just one problem: the apple was hardâ€”all too hard for the ant to bite into. The ant tried to eat the apple, but it couldn't break through the tough skin. The ant felt frustrated and defeated.

But the bird, being a resourceful and compassionate friend, had an idea. The bird decided to help the ant break the apple's skin. So, with a swift peck of its beak, the bird cracked the apple, making it easy for the ant to eat.

The ant and the bird then enjoyed a delicious meal, happily munching on the apple together. Their beautiful friendship continued to grow stronger, and they lived out their lives in the forest, looking out for each other and enjoying the bountiful fruits of their friendship.
