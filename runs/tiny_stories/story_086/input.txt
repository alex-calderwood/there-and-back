Once upon a time, there was a little mixer named Mixy. Mixy was very useful in the kitchen. He loved to help Mommy mix things like cake and cookies.
One day, Mixy was helping Mommy make a big cake. They were having so much fun. But then, Mixy saw a big spider on the wall. Mixy started to panic. He was scared of spiders. He said, "Mommy, help! There is a big spider on the wall!"
Mommy saw the spider and said, "Don't worry, Mixy. I will help you." She took a cup and carefully caught the spider. Then, she let it go outside. Mixy was so happy that the spider was gone. He said, "Thank you, Mommy. You are the best!"
After that, Mixy and Mommy finished making the cake. They had a great time together, and Mixy felt very useful again.
