One day, a small cat named Tom went to the park. He saw a big seat and thought, "I want to sit there!" Tom walked to the seat, but a big dog was sitting on it. The dog looked at Tom and said, "This is my seat. I am big and important, so I sit here."
Tom felt sad and walked away. He found a small seat under a tree. As he sat down, he heard a loud sound. A big ball fell from the sky and landed on the big seat, breaking it. The big dog jumped away, scared.
Tom looked at the broken seat and then at his small seat. He smiled and said, "I am happy with my small seat. It is important to me." The big dog came to Tom and said, "I am sorry. Can I sit with you?" Tom said yes, and they both sat on the small seat, happy and safe.
