Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was a very brave boy. One day, Tim and his mom went to the park. The park had a big slide, swings, and a sandbox. Tim loved to play at the park.
It rained the day before, so the park was wet. But today, the sun was shining, and it was dry. Tim went to the slide first. He climbed up and slid down with a big smile on his face. Then he went to the swings and swung high in the sky.
After playing on the swings, Tim saw a little girl crying near the sandbox. She was scared to play because the sand was still wet. Tim wanted to help her. He thought for a moment and then used his brave heart to dry the sand with his hands. The little girl stopped crying and played with Tim. They became best friends and had a fun day at the park.
