It was a beautiful sunny day at the park. Lily and her dog Spot decided to play their favorite game, hide-and-seek. With the park filled with trees and bushes, it was the perfect place for their little game.

Spot wagged his tail in excitement as they stood in the park. Lily decided to seek, while Spot was the one to hide. "Ready, Spot?" asked Lily, and the dog barked in response.

Spot bolted off and started hiding, seeking refuge behind a big tree nearby. He knew that this was Lily's favorite game, and he was determined to make it as exciting as possible for her.

Meanwhile, Lily closed her eyes and started counting. After reaching the count of ten, she opened her eyes, eager to begin seeking. Looking around the park, Lily noticed that Spot wasn't very far away. She giggled, seeing his tail sticking out from behind the tree.

As Lily approached the tree, Spot tried his best to stay concealed. But as soon as Lily reached the tree, she exclaimed, "Found you, Spot!" The dog's tail wagged even harder, and he jumped out from behind the tree, clearly delighted to have been discovered.

The two friends shared a joyful moment, celebrating their fun game of hide-and-seek. As the sun continued to shine, Lily and Spot continued to frolic and play, making the most of the beautiful day at the park.
