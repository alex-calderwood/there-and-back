Lily and Spot, two young friends, decided to have some fun at the park on a sunny afternoon. The game? Hide-and-seek, of course! Spot volunteered to be the hider, and Lily, as eager as ever, agreed to be the seeker.

Lily covered her eyes and began counting while Spot scampered off to find a hiding place. Spot was fast and good at hiding, but today, he chose to hide in plain sight. He dashed across the park and hid behind a bush, with a tiny bit of his tail sticking out.

Once Lily finished counting, she spun around and started seeking. Spot, believing his hiding place was sufficient, stayed as still as possible. Lily scanned the park and almost immediately spotted something unusual about the bush. She noticed a small, wagging tail and couldn't help but giggle.

Approaching the bush, she exclaimed, "Found you, Spot!" The game was over, and Lily had succeeded in finding her friend. The two friends, delighted by the game, spent the rest of the afternoon playing and basking in the warmth of their shared happiness.
