One day, a shy cat named Kitty found a puzzle. She wanted to play with it. Kitty tried to put the pieces together, but it was hard. She felt sad because she could not do it alone.
Kitty saw her friend, a dog named Buddy. She asked him for help. "Can you help me with this puzzle?" Kitty said. Buddy was happy to help. "Yes, I can help you," he replied.
Together, Kitty and Buddy worked on the puzzle. They put the pieces together and finished it. They were very happy. Kitty thanked Buddy for his help. They played with the puzzle all day and became best friends.
