Once upon a time, there was a tidy little house. In the house, there was a square box. Inside the square box, there was a toy cat. The toy cat was not happy. It would complain every day.
One day, a little boy found the square box. He opened it and saw the toy cat. The toy cat said, "I am sad. I want to play." The little boy smiled and said, "I will play with you!"
The little boy and the toy cat played all day. They had so much fun. At night, the little boy put the toy cat back in the tidy house. The toy cat was happy now. It did not complain anymore. They played together every day, and they were the best of friends.
