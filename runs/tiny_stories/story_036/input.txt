Once upon a time, there was a tidy room. In the room, there was a box. Inside the box, there were many pins. The pins were happy and loved their home. They liked to play games and have fun together.
One day, a big wind came and blew the box open. The pins fell out of the box and onto the floor. They were scared and did not know what to do. They started to panic. The pins wanted to go back to their tidy home, but they did not know how.
Then, a little girl came into the room. She saw the pins on the floor and wanted to help. She picked up the pins one by one and put them back in the box. The pins were so happy to be back in their tidy home. They thanked the little girl for her help.
But, the little girl had a secret. She was not just any little girl, she was a fairy! She used her magic to make the pins come alive. The pins were so excited to be able to move and play even more games together.
From that day on, the pins and the fairy girl became best friends. They played together every day and had lots of fun. The pins never had to panic again, because they knew their fairy friend would always be there to help them.
