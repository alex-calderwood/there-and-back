It was a particularly dreary day, and Lily and Ben found themselves utterly bored. There seemed to be no end to their listlessness, and their mother worried how she could make them happy again.

Ben, struggling to find something entertaining, decided to start rolling across the couch. He rolled back and forth, gradually gaining momentum. Eventually, he stopped rolling, slightly dizzy but certainly not bored anymore. He decided to lie down and take a break, waiting for the dizziness to fade.

Once the room stopped spinning, Ben got up, a big grin on his face. He had found a simple but effective method to combat boredom, and for the moment, he was happy.

Curious about her brother's antics, Lily decided to give it a try. She too began rolling from one end of the couch to the other, and soon the air was filled with the sound of laughter. When she finally stopped, she too found herself dizzy and in need of rest. She lay down, waiting for the dizziness to subside.

A moment later, Lily got up, feeling joyful and invigorated. Both she and Ben had turned a boring day into a fun and memorable one. Their mother, who had been silently watching from the doorway, smiled at her children's newfound happiness, her heart warmed by the sound of their laughter.
