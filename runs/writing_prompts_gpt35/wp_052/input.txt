I could feel the gravel grind under my sneaker, as I pushed off to start my run across the 10 miles that lay ahead of me. The air was very cool and crisp, the sky lit only by the pale moonlight. It was absolutely breathtaking.


I could feel the cool air rush along every hair on my arm, the gravel felt amazing under thin, worn out sneakers. I had been training on this same route for the last 5 weeks.


I woke up from a dream, that night that I first started running. I had been putzing around with running for years now. But that dream, left me determined. In the dream, I was in a cloud of white smoke. It was cool, just like the air tonight, and my legs felt just as they do now too. Strong and lean. In fact, my entire body felt strong and lean. The dream left me feeling as though I was literally chasing my dreams, taking advantage of the life that I had. Something good was going to come my way, I could just feel it.


Tonight I was what felt like 5 minutes into the run, when i reached my turn around point. It was at a small tree, in the middle of this barren field of gravel and weeds. The branches were bare, but looked gorgeous under the moonlight. I stopped to admire the beauty, as my breath turned into white vapor as it left my mouth. I took one step closer towards the tree, my foot crunching the snow that lay beneath. I had n't seen that before, but the sound was comforting.

I ran my fingertips along the trunk of the tree, which was cold and wet from the snow, just to see that it was real. Just to see confirm that I had made it there tonight.

I turned around, and set off my run back. I could hear howling behind me, as a white smoke started to swirl around me. It felt strange, but good. It pushed me more. As I ran, I felt myself getting lighter and lighter. I could hear footsteps running along either side of me. I looked to my left and right. There are wolves running along side me. I didn't know what was going on, I felt a little frightened, but kept going as the white cloud pulled me along. I finally stopped myself, This felt insane.

I twirled around as the cloud of smoke disappeared, the wild animals on either side of me take off to my left. I 'm in the middle of the gravel field completely alone, as I remember : I was bit by a werewolf years ago. My eyes dart straight to full moon that was just uncovered by the clouds, and then too the ground in a panic. I see the sneakers I 'm leaving behind. . . . as my own thoughts fade and I feel myself drift along to follow the pack. . . . .
