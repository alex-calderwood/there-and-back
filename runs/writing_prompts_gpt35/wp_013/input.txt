The sun filtered through the giant glass windows as Andrew slumped down into the plush couching. His teeth stung as he sucked air down into his lungs and almost unconsciously he dug his fingers into his thigh until it was no more.

Toes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, *thighs*.

It was almost a miracle he had survived thus far -- one person could only stay hidden for so long. The windows were his biggest contender, what with every human's need for vitamin D and his particular affinity for basking in the warm daylight.

Dazed, he glanced up at the window and one corner of his mouth twitched as he spotted a crow perched on the delapidated tree planted purposefully right outside his wall.

Apollo was always right. The crow shrieked. One lone black wing sank to the grass.

With a whoosh, feathers pierced through his darkening skin and erupted into ruffled plumage. For a brief moment he choked and then he found himself perched upon the ground, wings spread and beak parted.

Freedom could only ever be found in others -- an ironic twist in the land of the free -- and for now, Andrew sought it out in the pain of that which was foolish enough to find his window to the world. This was left for the human mind though, the very mind which was now buried deep beneath the crow's. The crow sought the sun, and the sun it would have.

Upon landing, he folded his wings and preened. His claws clicked idly on the mahogany desk, leaving tiny prints in the manila envelopes and white cardstock that littered the surface. The countdown began.

The sun warmed his feathers. His beady eyes focused on the ants that paraded through a crack in the wall. A flash of light danced around the room for a brief second. The countdown ended.

As quickly as it came, it left, and the crow mind vanished as the feathers retreated back into the ashen skin from which they came.

Toes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, *waist*.

H groaned, choking on the pain that inched up his spine and threaded its way through his skull. This was it, his last moments, and he couldn't even get off his desk.

Toes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, *chest*.

Suddenly breathing was impossible and as the last shreds of consciousness crawled their way out of his skull, Andrew slammed his hand onto the desk.

" Mr. President? " The woman stood at the entrance to the room, a closed fist to her chest. Her frown slowly raised and with one step she was within the room.

Toes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, chest. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, chest, *life*.


" That 'll be Ms. President, now. " Her hand opened and a black feather fluttered idly to the ground.
