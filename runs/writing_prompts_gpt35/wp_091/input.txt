Dear me,
I 'm sorry you feel so awful. I 'm sorry you can't stop thinking about the breakup. No one should have to feel this pain. I thought I knew her better than I actually did. I tried to make her into something she isnt. Do n't do that next time. But also, don't pick someone who you feel you have to change. In a year or two look back on this and hopefully you 'll have learned a little something about relationships and how to succeed in them and make them healthy. Your first one started great but ended up in heartbreak. I 'm also sorry you have to use such cliche terms. Do n't be angry you aren't original- rejoice that you aren't the first person to deal with something like this. Forgive yourself for being her cage. You should have been her love bird by her side, the only cage you two have is the world. You are young, you don't know how the world works, learn from it and move on. Self, please try to stop hurting. Please just try to move on already. I 'm begging you.

Yours truly,
Myself
