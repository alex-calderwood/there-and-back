*Hey, I know that you posted this a million years ago, but I started a response, and figured I would post it and send it in. I am not very happy with it, so any constructive criticism you can give would be appreciated it. I don't know if it's just that I 'm not good at writing dialogue, I picked a " story " without a good arc, or I just picked an annoying topic. And, it turns out it is too long, so I 'll have to post some in replies. Grr. Sorry you didn't get more responses, I think the topic is interesting. *

Pat was putting the finishing touches on her desk when Candice approached her.

" Patricia ! " The older woman crooned, " Welcome to the company. We ' re all very excited to have a bright young lady like you become part of the company. I ' m Candice, from sales "

Pat turned to the woman behind her, opening her arms for a firm, business like hug. As you would expect from a saleswoman, Candice was impeccably dressed. Her Grecian shift flowed over her round bosom and hips. The sandals she had chosen for today completed the outfit to a T, and the folds expertly hid her pockets, leaving Candice looking free, mobile and capable. Pat felt like her own gauzy skirt and blouse were a little too utilitarian in comparison.

" You must be hungry, with all of the paperwork you ' ve had to do this morning. " Candice purred, " Why don ' t I take you to lunch? "

" Oh, yes ! That would be great. " Pat replied, " I think David is still out at Staples getting some supplies Mary needed. He should be back any minute. "

" Hmmm, Davie, yes. " Candice ' s full, graceful features distorted slightly for a moment, " I think the guys are going to take him out for a burger or something. I ' ve got a favorite spot in mind for us, and I don ' t think that he would feel like he fits in there. "

Pat looked over at David ' s desk, uncertain. She wouldn ' t want him to feel left out, but he probably would be more comfortable being around other men, and Candice seemed impatient to leave.

On the car ride to the restaurant, Candice shared her life story. It was what you would expect of a top saleswoman. She had been in a well-respected dance group in High School, had been influential in her school ' s model World Commune, and had worked on three different teams that had successfully implemented community projects in her town. She had decided not to go to college, and had instead started selling immediately, beginning with small copy shops, moving to insurance, and then finally into custom manufacturing.
