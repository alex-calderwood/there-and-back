As if looking back at a sun-cast shadow, only to realise just how far it had moved while I looked away, I started at my face in the mirror.

It was my face, surely. I knew it was my face. It looked like me, and yet it didn't quite look like me. It did not look like me as I thought I looked. It was indescribable, as nearly everything that seemed different seemed exactly the same as before.

Worse still was that I knew why I looked like I did not remember looking. Simply knowing it would happen, as it was happening, caused me to forget that it had happened. And so I did not see it.

The sadness of my mistakes hung beneath my eyes ; the joy of my successes lined my mouth and lips from raising so many smiles. The fury of my youth ceased my forehead, while wisdom and forgiveness smoothed my eyes into soothing glass.

I have come a very long way ; done so much with my time. I examined my new-old face and the life that shaped it, memorizing how I looked to compare with the next time I saw a new face in my mirror.
