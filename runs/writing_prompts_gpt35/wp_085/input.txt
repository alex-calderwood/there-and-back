I shut off the my phone alarm for the 3rd time. I notice I don't have a line of notifications from email, text, whatever that I normally do. Whatever, I take my meds, and pull up Facebook before I actually have to leave my bed. The app does n't actually load, longer than even a long usual lag. My phone shows no connectivity for wifi or service.

**Strange**

Sometimes when the internet is acting up I try to fix it, sometimes I just leave it for my husband to figure it out. He works in secure satellite communications, and our tech set up is a little beefier than your average residence.

I have some time, my curiosity is peaked. I go down stairs, feed the bunny, **huh, we must have lost power at some point, the clocks are blinking** and then I turn on the TV.

We don't have cable, our TV is connected to a computer. We watch Netflix, use his parent's HBO login, ect. for our TV content. I start messing around, checking the wifi, restart the router, just basic stuff. Nothing is working. I hear excited voices outside, not the good, happy kind of voices.

I peek out my window to see several of my neighbors standing in the parking lot of our town house community. They seem collectively upset, new neighborhood drama it seems.

I throw some acceptable clothes on and step outside. The small group immediately looks up.

" Is your phone workin '? " Nancy from across the way asks.

" Uh, it's on, just not connecting to wifi or the network " I replied

" Yeah ! None of ours are ! No internet or phone at all. It's really strange !. " Her voice carried an extra note of concern than usual.

" It's ridiculous. " Tom from 2 doors down cuts in. " We have electricity ! Although that must have gone out too some time last night. What's with the connection? I tell ya, Comcast charges more every year, and their service just gets shittier. And they know they can do it ! Because they are the only supplier ! "

The group murmers their agreement. A couple more neighbors start filling in their stories of no internet, and frustration with the shitty hand we 're delt by providers. The school bus pulls up to the curb of subdued kids, who are looking gloomier than usual. They are a good 20 some yards behind me, and I 'm not paying attention until I start to realize the bus driver is addressing the group of kids and parents. Our little group turn to listen. Apparently school is cancelled, because of the internet outage. The drivers are making their rounds just to let parent's know, since the phones are down. Many are upset, since they had n't planned to be home with the kids.

" Your work may not be open either " the bus driver reasoned with the agitated parents. He closed up and headed to the next stop, as kids and parents dispersed.

Molly from next door walked back with her two kids. " Great, stuck at home with the kids, and we don't even have internet or TV. And you better believe my boss is gon na take this out of my sick days. "

I 'm at least a little sympathetic, her second grader has been going through a rebellious phase. She isn't a bad kid really, just has been very difficult recently. The 3 year old has started to emulate the attitude as well.

The rage of the miscellaneous group of people is building.

Just then, my husband's coworker pulls up.

" Sam ! " The urgency in his voice is uncharacteristic for his very laid back manner.

" Hey John, what's up? " My rage isn't building, but my concern is towering.

" Uh " he glances nerviously at the group of people now focused on the newest distraction, himself. " Let's go inside for a minute. "
