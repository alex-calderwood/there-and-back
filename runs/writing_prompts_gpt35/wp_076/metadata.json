                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

He watched the waves roll in, sparkling blue except for the white bubbling crest at the top, sending tiny crabs skittering away as they washed up onto the sandy shore. Neverland was a beautiful place, but it felt as if it were a prison.\n\nPeter often sat in the same precise spot, he couldn't remember the last evening he had n't been there. Straight ahead, a ways beyond where the waves broke and the sea was more still, just gently rolling was half of Hook's ship, broken and haggard looking, the bow thrusting up from the sea. The ship was covered in green moss, and barnacles clung to the rotten wood. Hook was long dead, and Peter had n't seen another pirate in years.\n\nPeter sat thinking about the fights he and old Hook had had. Man, it had been a great time for some stretch of years. The lunging, the thrusts, the swords clanking together, the trusty dagger Peter kept at his waist. Then came Wendy, and her annoying little brothers, and with their help, Peter had put an end to Hook for good, though he knew in his heart he had n't really wanted to. It was all a game, a game so fun they played it every day for decades. But then Hook had died, and the rest of the pirates moved off, and Peter was okay at first because he had Wendy. But then she had went home, and had n't come back. And she took the Lost Boys with her. Then for a long time it was just Peter. Peter and the savages, but now they were all gone too, claimed by some mysterious illness that had swept through their tribe. Peter remained healthy.\n\nIn the years since Peter had gotten some kids to come to Neverland, and it was fun, but never the same. They would swoop through the air, hollering with joy. But there were no pirates to fight, no adventures to be had, so the children would bore easily and leave, leaving Peter alone once more. He had Tinkerbell of course, for some time, but she too was gone now, along with all of the other fairies, because there simply had n't been enough people to believe.\n\nNow Peter couldn't even get kids to come with him. The world was so different now. Not Neverland, but the place beyond, through the sky, past the stars. Children were too attached to these strange electronic boxes, they had everything they could want, there was no imagination. Everything could be given to you for real, you didn't need to pretend. Peter was still a child, and he felt as if he were the last child, even when there was a place full of them.\n\nSo Peter came to the beach each night and stared at what remained of Hooks ship without really seeing it. The waves broke on the beach and the sun fell through the blue sky, turning it orange and purple before it all faded to black."
