I 've been her for a week or two and it's honestly not too bad. They are being really nice to me cause they know if they arnt I could tell general yost zed that I was not John Baker. That's who they were supposed to abduct. I heard them talking about it after they gave me a translator for my initial interogation and realized they messed up right in the middle of that. Apparently zudd and mog got me instead by accident and would be executed if their general found out. You see, my name is Jon baker, they must have just gotten confused and snagged me instead. Do n't ask me how they screwed up that bad, I think they might be interns judging by some of their conversations. Usually they would take my translator so I couldn't understand them until they needed more info from me but I made them agree durring initial interrogation let me keep it in exchange for me not telling their general about their little mistake. But to be honest I 'm kinda starting to like zudd and mog. They are pretty nice guys and I like it up here. The food here is made with a synthetic chemical designed to taste exactly like whatever you 're favorite food is and also adapts the texture of said thing. I honestly don't feel like a prisoner at all. I have enough leverage that I live more like a crew member than a prisoner. In fact, I 'm actually on the main flight deck with zubb and mog playing blackjack right now. I had some cards on me when I was abducted and tought them some earth games and it's been great. But there is one problem.

My current predicament is that today it seems they found the correct John baker. Just in time too as the general finally visited the holding deck today. Problem for zubb and mog is that they already told him over a holocom call that I was John baker.
