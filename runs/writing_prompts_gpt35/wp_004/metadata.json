                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

                "content": "<|Story|>\nReentry had become more and more simple these past years. Of course, that had mostly been on planets with a lower gravitational force than earth. Over the roar of the slowly dying warp engine, the techs assured me that the small rockets attached to the heat proof material that covered my calves would get me to 8, 000 feet before my suit depressurized. Of course, that wasn't what I was worried about. Theoretically, I would arrive there faster than I did when I normally did this on any other planet, the gravity would account for that.\n\nI was much more worried about the strength of the wingsuit I was being strapped into. I knew it had worked when I used it on Mercury and Venus, but here? This had never actually been tried before. I didn't voice my concerns however. . . that's not what a squad leader did. \" Team, move out ! \", I barked when the suits were secure. I walked my team to the airlock, as opposed to our normal jog. Why not? We had plenty of time. Today, we would have to wait for a small shuttle to be dropped down to the planet. Normally, we could return to space using one of the massive space elevators was attached to.\n\nBut not the Earth. We 'd left this planet far before we had invented that technology. That had only made it harder for everyone to leave. Fifteen minutes after we had arrived at the airlock, I received the order to jump. \" Team, let's go ! \" I yelled, trying to ease the nervous soldiers as I punched the button that would open this side of the airlock. THis time, we did jog, and as soon as we were all in the airlock, I ordered the men to pressurize. At once, each and every one of them punched a pad on their upper left shoulder, and a hiss was heard as the suits absorbed the air of the surrounding area. I sealed the airlock, and opened it to revel the Earth.\n\nI jumped, and immediately afterwards, as they had been trained, my squad jumped after me, already in formation. This was the reason I had joined the military. Our rockets were programmed to activate 14 seconds after the outside air had lost pressure, which was exactly how long it took for every man to leave the giant hulking ship which would remain in this very spot until we returned.\n\nMy men, as per my orders, could see nothing on their HUDs but incoming dangers. I liked it that way, where they couldn't see their speeds or altitudes, no one could argue with me about not following regulation. There was no regulating for this jump however. Like arrows, we all plunged towards the Earth, arms at our sides, traveling at speeds now of more than 3, 000 miles per hour. As the altimeter on my HUD alerted me that we were are 20, 000 feet above the Earth, I tapped a combination on my palm, immediately projecting orders to my men to flatten their bodies to begin losing speed. We would have to be traveling less than 800 miles per hour before we could activate our wingsuits. Of course, if we reached that speed before we had descended to 8, 000 feet, it didn't matter what the techs had said. . . we would never make it before the suits depressurized.\n\nAs we reached speeds at which the suits insulation kept the noise out, I could hear myself breathing heavily. Any second now, and we would be at 800 miles per hour. I breathed a sigh of relief as my altimeter ticked \" 8, 000 \". Looking back at the speedometer, I saw I had looked away for too long, we were now at 650 miles per hour. To activate our wingsuits, we would need to tilt back down towards the ground, or they would rip our limbs from our bodies and kill us immediately. I tapped out the command, and every soldier shifted into a 30 degree angle towards the ground.\n\nI tapped out another order, and every soldier simultaneously put their arms out and squeezed both hands into a fist, activating their wingsuits. Any minute now, we would be on Earth again. . . and Earth which looked luscious and green to me. Life was not a stranger to this planet I realized, turning towards the flare our dropped shuttle had activated. And suddenly, it was over. I was on the ground. . . and everything melted away, as I removed my helmet, and was hit by the first blast of fresh oxygen I had ever felt. I wouldn't like it after I left here, I realized. . . not at all."
