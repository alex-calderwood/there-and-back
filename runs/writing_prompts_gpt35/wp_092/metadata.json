                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

Her two eldest daughters, twins of identical beauty, were sixteen this year and would finally be allowed to take lovers. They had spent the last several weeks learning about, trying on, and playing with various paints, perfumes, and dyes to look their best. Now since ablutions they had not come out of their chambers, refusing until they looked perfect.\n\n\" Let them make themselves as beautiful as they desire, \" Diana mother, Artemia, said, coming out of another room with her grandson in her arms. He was clothed in gentle cloth for the day was hot, and there would be traveling for several hours. \" They may have flirted and exchanged blushing comments last year with the young men, but it is another thing entirely to go to their beds. \"\n\n\" I know. But it is silly to make yourself perfect now, before we travel. \" Of course that was something you learned because it happened to you, not because your mother said so.\n\nDiana took her son from her mother with a sad smile, trying to keep from falling into anguish again. She had managed to remain cheerful until now, not giving too much thought to the time ahead. Her daughters were women, and her son. . . In four days they would be back in their women's city and her son would no longer be in her arms. At barely three months he still needed his mother's touch and milk, but as a man he could not stay any longer than the time between birth and the yearly Meeting. She wanted to keep him, hold him for at least another year. . if he went now he might die. But that was why they were separated, or so legends said. Women were sentimental in a way men were not. She had carried and bore her son, while his father had only known his own pleasure a year past. He might not even take the boy into his home when they met again. There would be no choice other than to lay her precious child at the gates and leave, praying with every breath that someone would open their doors and take in the child. . she had seen it happen, once as a younger girl. A woman leaving her son, the cries throughout the day that reached their caravan. . . the cries that did not stop after the men left for their own home. The cries of the mother after the cries of her child had finally stopped.\n\n\" Perhaps if we say I and he are ill, and can not travel? \"\n\n\" You can not. \" Artemia stroked Agapios's cheek and then hugged her daughter tightly. \" The gods would know you lie, and there would be punishment brought down upon us. \"\n\n\" What if he is not accepted? \"\n\n\" Sh. He was your lover, do you distrust yourself so much? This is a happy time. Your daughters are women, you may find yourself a grandmother soon as well. You told me he was kind and dear. You will spend the two days with him, speaking about your son, and being a family. \"\n\nShe nodded, sniffling and wiping away tears. \" You are right, mother, of course. Such a heartless act has not happened in years. \"\n\n\" Mother ! \"\n\n\" Mama ! \"\n\nHer two daughters finally dashed down the hall to them, one with her sandals and the other with bare feet. Their make-up was a little heavy, and they wore a bit too much scent, but they were smiling and proud of their appearance. After a day of walking the extra would be gone anyway, and she could help reapply moderate amounts.\n\n\" You look lovely. \" Tears welled in her eyes again but she blinked them back. Silly emotions, she had forgotten how strong they were during and soon after a babe. The family took what few things they would needed to bring, gave thanks to the gods, and began their journey to see the men.\n\n-- -\n\nReally fun premise, OP. I might take it and work it into a book, if that's alright. I write fantasy stories in a large world ranging from ancient to Victorian, and this could go well with my 'Ancient Greek ' section of the world."
