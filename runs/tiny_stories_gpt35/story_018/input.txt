Once there was a jolly little girl called Daisy. She always loved searching around her house to find new and exciting spots. One day, when she was looking around her bedroom, she found a very interesting spot. It was hidden away behind the curtain, and Daisy was very excited. 
She carefully pulled back the curtain to see what was in the spot. To her surprise, she discovered a treasure chest! Daisy was delighted and couldn't wait to open the box. She opened it up and found lots of shiny coins inside! She gathered up the coins and couldn't stop smiling - she had found a real treasure!
Daisy took the coins out of the box and searched around for a safe place to store them. She found a secret spot in her Toys cupboard and put the coins away. Whenever she wanted, Daisy could take the coins out and count them again. She was so jolly that a spot had led her to such a lovely treasure!
