Once upon a time, in a warm summer, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to wear her favorite dress with flowers on it. She liked to play outside in the sun with her friends.
One day, while Lily was playing, she saw a big, confused dog. The dog was wearing a funny hat. Lily had never seen a dog wear a hat before. She laughed and wanted to help the dog. She took off the hat and the dog wagged its tail happily.
Suddenly, the dog changed into a fairy! The fairy said, "Thank you, Lily, for helping me. I was stuck as a dog because of my hat." Lily was surprised but happy. The fairy gave Lily a magic flower to keep. From that day on, Lily and the fairy were best friends, and they played together all summer.
