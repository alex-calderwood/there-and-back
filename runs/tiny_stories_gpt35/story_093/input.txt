One day, a girl named Sue went to the store with her mom. They needed to choose a new mop because their old mop was dirty and disgusting. Sue was very excited to help her mom pick the best mop.
At the store, they saw many mops. There were big mops and small mops. Sue liked a mop with a pink handle. Her mom liked a mop with a blue handle. They could not choose which one to get. Then, something unexpected happened.
A little dog ran into the store. It had a mop in its mouth! The mop was not disgusting. It was clean and pretty. The dog put the mop at Sue's feet. Sue and her mom looked at each other and smiled. They knew they had found the perfect mop. They thanked the dog and took the mop home.
