Lily liked to read books. She had many books on her bookshelf in her room. She liked to look at the pictures and learn new words. Sometimes, she read the books to her teddy bear, who listened very well.
One day, Lily was reading a book about animals. She saw a picture of a lion. The lion had a large mane and sharp teeth. Lily thought the lion was very brave and strong. She wanted to be like the lion. She said to her teddy bear, "Roar! I am a lion! Hear me roar!"
But when she tried to roar, she felt a tickle in her nose. She tried to stop it, but she could not. She sneezed very loud. "Achoo!" The sneeze was so loud that it made the bookshelf shake. Some of the books fell down and hit the floor. Lily was scared. She thought the bookshelf would fall on her and her teddy bear.
She ran to her mom, who was in the kitchen. She hugged her mom and said, "Mom, I sneezed and the books fell down. I am sorry. I did not mean to do it."
Her mom smiled and said, "It's okay, Lily. You did not do anything wrong. Sometimes, we sneeze and we can't help it. It's nothing to be sorry for. Let's go and pick up the books together. Maybe we can find another book to read. How about a book about flowers? They don't make you sneeze."
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, mom. I like flowers. They are pretty and smell nice. Thank you, mom. You are the best."
Her mom kissed her and said, "You are welcome, Lily. You are the best, too. And you are my little lion. You are brave and strong, even when you sneeze."
