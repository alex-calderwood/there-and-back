Once upon a time there was a small kitty who was very hungry. She was meowing loudly, searching for food. Suddenly, she saw a mug full of food in the garden and ran towards it.
The kitty started feeding, when all of a sudden, a big dog appeared. The kitty was so scared that she stopped eating and hid. The dog was very deaf and couldn't heard the kitty meowing. The kitty was thinking, 'What should I do?'. She quickly had an idea.
The kitty started to meow very loudly and vigorously. Suddenly, the deaf dog heard her - it pricked up its ears and ran away. The kitty breathed a huge sigh of relief.
The kitty was so happy that she keep eating from the old mug, until she was fully fed. After that, she thanked the mug and went away happily.
