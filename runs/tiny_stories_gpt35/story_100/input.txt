Lily and Ben are bored. They want to play, but it is raining outside. They look around the living room for something fun to do.
"Let's roll on the couch!" Lily says. She likes to roll on the soft cushions and feel the wind in her hair.
"Okay!" Ben says. He follows his sister to the couch and they both climb on it. They start to roll from one end to the other, laughing and giggling.
They roll faster and faster, until they feel dizzy. They stop and look at each other. Their faces are red and their eyes are wide.
"Wow, that was fun!" Lily says. "But I feel dizzy. Do you feel dizzy, Ben?"
"Yes, I feel dizzy too," Ben says. "Let's lie down for a bit."
They lie down on the couch and close their eyes. They feel the couch spinning under them. They hold hands and smile.
They hear their mom coming into the living room. She sees them on the couch and smiles too.
"Did you have fun, kids?" she asks.
"Yes, mom, we did!" Lily and Ben say. "We rolled on the couch!"
Mom hugs them and kisses them. She says, "That's great, but be careful not to roll too much. You might get sick."
Lily and Ben nod. They say, "We love you, mom."
They love their mom, and they love their couch. They love to roll on it, but not too much. They love to play, even when it rains. They are happy.
