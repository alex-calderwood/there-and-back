Once upon a time, there was a big garden. In the garden, there were many interesting things. There were pretty flowers, green trees, and soft grass. The garden was a fun place to play.
One day, a little cat came to the garden. The cat was very tired. It looked around and saw a nice spot under a tree. The cat thought it was a good place to sleep. So, it lay down and closed its eyes.
While the cat was sleeping, a little bird came and sat on the tree. The bird saw the cat and thought it was interesting. The bird sang a sweet song to the cat. The cat woke up and saw the bird. They became friends and played together in the garden. And from that day on, they both loved to sleep and play in the interesting garden.
