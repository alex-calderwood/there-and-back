Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a boy named Tim. Tim was very enthusiastic about playing with his friends. One day, he found a mask in his toy box. It was a big, funny mask that covered his whole face.
Tim wore the mask and went to play with his friends. When he got there, they all laughed and said, "Who are you? We don't know you!" Tim giggled and said, "It's me, Tim! I have a mask on my face!"
His friends wanted to see his face, so they asked him to remove the mask. Tim took off the mask, and they all laughed together. They all took turns wearing the mask and playing fun games. They had a great day and learned that even with a mask on, they were still the same friends.
