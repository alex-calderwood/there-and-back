Lily liked to admire her mother's tea set. It was shiny and pretty, with flowers and birds on it. She wanted to play with it, but her mother said no. It was only for grown-ups, and it could break easily.
One day, when her mother was busy, Lily saw the tea set on the table. She thought it would be fun to have a tea party with her dolls. She was very careful, and took one cup and one saucer. She filled the cup with water from the sink, and pretended it was tea. She gave it to her doll, and said, "Here you are, Daisy. Drink your tea and be polite."
She did not see her brother Tom sneak up behind her. He was bored, and wanted to make trouble. He saw Lily playing with the tea set, and he had a foolish idea. He grabbed the cup from the doll, and threw it on the floor. It smashed into pieces, and water splashed everywhere.
Lily screamed, and started to cry. She was very sad and angry. She loved the tea set, and now it was ruined. She ran to her mother, and told her what Tom did. Her mother was very upset, and scolded Tom. She said he was naughty and mean, and he had to apologize to Lily and help clean up the mess.
Tom felt sorry for what he did. He realized he was foolish, and he hurt his sister. He said he was sorry, and he hugged Lily. He helped her pick up the broken cup, and dry the floor. He promised he would never do it again. Lily forgave him, and they hugged again. Their mother smiled, and said they could have a real tea party later, with a different set. She said she still loved them both, even when they made mistakes.
