Once upon a time, in a quiet little town, there was a cat named Tom. Tom was a very stubborn cat. He liked to play with his friends, but he did not like to share his toys. One sunny day, Tom's friend, a dog named Max, came to play with him. They played on the grass and ran around the trees.
Max saw a ball on the side of the road and wanted to play with it. He asked Tom if he could play with the ball too. But Tom refused to share the ball with Max. Max was sad and did not want to play with Tom anymore. He went away to find other friends to play with.
Tom felt lonely without Max and realized that he should have shared the ball. He went to find Max and said sorry. Tom promised to share his toys from now on. Max forgave Tom, and they played happily together with the ball. From that day on, Tom always shared his toys, and they had lots of fun together.
