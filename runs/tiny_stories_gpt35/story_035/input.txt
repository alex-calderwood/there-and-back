Once upon a time, there was a little human named Tim. Tim was a regular boy who loved to play outside. One day, Tim saw a big box in his room. He did not know what was inside. He wanted to open it, but his mom said, "Wait for your birthday."
Tim's birthday was in two days. He thought about the big box all the time. He could not wait to see what was inside. Tim was so excited that he could not sleep. He knew that his birthday would be a special day.
On his birthday, Tim opened the big box. Inside was a big cake! But, because Tim did not listen to his mom, the cake was spoiled. It was not good to eat. Tim was sad, but he learned that he should listen to his mom. Next time, Tim will wait and not spoil the surprise.
