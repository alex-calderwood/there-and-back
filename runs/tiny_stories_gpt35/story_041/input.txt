Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Billy. Billy was a harmless bird who loved to fly and sing. He had a best friend named Tommy, the squirrel. They lived in a big tree in a sunny park.
One day, Billy and Tommy were playing together. Billy said, "I know a secret about wisdom! If you are kind to others, they will be kind to you." Tommy listened carefully and nodded his head.
As they played, they saw a lost baby bunny crying. They went to the bunny and asked, "Why are you sad?" The bunny said, "I can't find my mommy!" Billy and Tommy decided to help the bunny find her mommy. They looked everywhere and finally found the mommy bunny. She was so happy and said, "Thank you for helping my baby!"
Billy and Tommy learned that when you are kind and helpful, you make new friends. This is the wisdom they shared with others in the park. And they all lived happily ever after.
