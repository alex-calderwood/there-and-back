Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a new red wagon. He loved his wagon very much. He played with it every day. He put his toys in the wagon and pulled it around the yard.
One day, Tim saw a big tree. He wanted to shake the tree. He thought it would be fun to see the leaves fall. So, he left his new wagon under the tree and started to shake the tree with all his might.
As Tim shook the tree, a big wind came. The wind was so strong that it blew the new wagon away. Tim tried to run after it, but the wind was too fast. The new wagon was lost forever. Tim was very sad and went back home with tears in his eyes.
