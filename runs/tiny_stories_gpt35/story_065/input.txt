Mama and Baby were playing in the park. Baby loved to explore and often ran to the fence that seemed so exciting. 
Mama watched Baby closely, "No Baby, don't touch the fence," she said. 
But Baby didn't listen and reached out to touch the fence. "Ouch!," Baby said.
Mama quickly ran to Baby and picked her up. "That fence is very scary," Mama said, "it hurts if you touch it. We must be careful."
Baby nodded in agreement. “Yes Mama, I be careful and not touch the fence.” 
Mama and Baby hugged each other tightly and continued exploring the park. Baby was careful to keep far away from the fence and was happy not to be scared.
