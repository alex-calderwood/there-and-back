Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to wear his big red hat. He also had a spade. It was a brilliant spade. Tim liked to play with his spade in the sand.
One day, Tim went to the park. He wanted to dig a big hole with his spade. He started to dig and dig. Suddenly, he found a small box in the hole. Tim was very surprised.
He opened the box and saw a shiny key inside. Tim looked around and saw a little door in a tree. He put the key in the door and turned it. The door opened, and Tim found a room full of toys! It was a secret toy room. Tim was so happy and played there all day.
