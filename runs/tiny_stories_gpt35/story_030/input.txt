One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk in the dark woods. He wanted to meet new friends. As he walked, he saw a big tree. Tim thought it was a mystery tree because it looked different.
Tim said, "Hello, mystery tree! Do you want to be my friend?" The tree did not say anything. Tim felt sad, but he kept walking. Soon, he met a big, dark bear.
"Hi, bear!" said Tim. "Do you want to be my friend?" The bear looked at Tim and said, "Yes, I want to be your friend. But I am very hungry."
Tim tried to find food for his new friend, but he could not find any. The bear got hungrier and hungrier. Tim was scared.
In the end, the dark bear was too hungry and ate Tim. The mystery tree watched, but it could not help. The woods were dark and quiet again.
