Once upon a time, there was a dependable dog named Sam. Sam loved to play with his toy stack. He would knock them down and build them up again.
One day, Sam saw a big dog race. All the dogs wanted to win. Sam's friend, Ben, was in the race too. Sam said, "Ben, you can win! I will help you!"
Sam and Ben practiced running every day. They ran fast and had fun. On the day of the race, Sam cheered for Ben. Ben tried his best and won the race! Sam was so proud of his friend. They played with the toy stack to celebrate.
