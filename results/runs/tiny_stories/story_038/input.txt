Once upon a time, there was a little, honest girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys and her dog, Spot. They would run and jump in the big, green park. One day, Lily felt the urge to play hide and seek with Spot.
Lily hid behind a big tree and started to count. Spot ran to find a good place to hide. When Lily finished counting, she opened her eyes and started to look for Spot. She saw a bush moving and decided to peek.
Lily tiptoed to the bush and peeked inside. There was Spot, wagging his tail and happy to be found. Lily hugged Spot and they both laughed. They played hide and seek all day, having lots of fun. They were best friends forever.
