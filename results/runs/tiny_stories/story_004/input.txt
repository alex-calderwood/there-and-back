Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Chloe. Chloe liked to play in her garden with her friends. Each day, Chloe and her friends had lots of fun playing together. 
One day, one of Chloe's friends, Colin, mentioned a tomato. The tomato was really far away, in a distant land.
Chloe got really excited because she had never seen a tomato before. She asked Colin if she could come with him to get the tomato. Colin said no, because it was too far away. He said that she was too young and shouldn't go that far away.
Chloe was very disappointed, but she could see that Colin was right. She knew that she needed to listen to her friends and trust in them. From then on, she made sure to only do things that she was told were ok by her friends.
The moral of the story is to always listen to your friends and trust in them.
