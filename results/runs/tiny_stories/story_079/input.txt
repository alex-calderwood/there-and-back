One day, a boy named Tim went for a jog on Wednesday. He felt a little tired but wanted to have fun outside. Tim liked to run and play in the park. He saw many pretty flowers and tall trees. The sun was shining and the sky was blue.
As Tim jogged, he saw a big, round ball near a tree. He was surprised and thought it was a toy. He went closer to look at it. But when he touched the ball, it moved! Tim was scared and jumped back.
The ball opened up and a cute, little puppy came out. The puppy was tired too. It had been hiding in the ball to take a nap. Tim and the puppy became friends. They played together in the park and then jogged home. Tim was happy and not tired anymore.
