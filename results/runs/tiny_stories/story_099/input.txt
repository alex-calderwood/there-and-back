Lily likes to go to the zoo with her mom. She likes to see the animals and hear their sounds. She likes the monkeys, the lions, and the birds. But her favorite animal is the fish.
One day, she sees a big tank with many fish. She sees red fish, blue fish, yellow fish, and green fish. She sees fish with stripes, spots, and dots. She sees fish with long tails, short tails, and no tails. She sees fish that swim fast, slow, and in circles. She is very happy.
She sees a fish that is different from the others. It is brown and hairy. It has a big mouth and small eyes. It looks funny. She wants to know more about it.
She asks her mom, "Mom, what is that fish?"
Her mom looks at the tank and smiles. She says, "That is not a fish, Lily. That is an otter. An otter is an animal that lives in the water and on the land. It has hair to keep it warm. It likes to eat fish and play with rocks."
Lily is surprised. She says, "An otter? It looks like a fish with hair. Can I touch it?"
Her mom says, "No, Lily. You cannot touch the otter. It is not a pet. It is a wild animal. It might bite you or scratch you. You can only look at it and say hello."
Lily nods. She says, "Okay, mom. I will not touch the otter. I will just look at it and say hello. Hello, otter. You are a funny fish with hair. I like you."
