One day, a bright red ball was near a mailbox. A little girl saw the ball and wanted to play with it. She picked up the ball and threw it high in the sky. The ball went up, up, up, and then came down, down, down.
The ball did not end up where the girl thought it would. It went into the mailbox! The girl was sad. She wanted to play with the ball, but now it was stuck. She tried to get it out, but her hand was too big.
Just then, a small bird came by. The bird saw the girl was sad and wanted to help. The bird went into the mailbox and pushed the ball out with its beak. The girl was so happy! She said thank you to the bird and they both played with the ball. The day that started sad had a happy end.
