Amy was a little girl with a big imagination. She daydreamed about flying through the sky every time she rode her bike. One day, while cycling down the street, her bike pedal suddenly broke. Amy was devastated. She couldn't imagine a single day without her flying adventures.

Her mom, noticing the sadness in her eyes, decided to help Amy. They talked to their neighbor, the shop-man, who was always tinkering with various machines. He told them he could fix the pedal, so Amy could enjoy riding her bike again. Filled with hope, Amy became happy.

Amy, with her bike in tow, went to the shop-man's place. Once there, she watched as he carefully attached the new pedal, making sure it was tight and secure. As soon as he finished, Amy felt a wave of excitement knowing that she could fly through the sky once more.

Eager to see if the repairs had worked, Amy hopped on her bike and started pedaling. To her amazement, the bike began to lift off the ground. She soared through the air, higher and higher, her face beaming with happiness. As Amy flew over her town, her laughter echoed across the sky, and her mom and the shop-man knew that they had made her dreams come true.
