One day, a girl named Amy found a bike with a broken pedal. She wanted to ride it, but she couldn't. She felt sad. Amy's mom saw her and said, "Don't worry, we can fix it."
Amy's mom reminded her of the perfect bike shop nearby. They walked to the shop together. The shop man looked at the bike and said, "I can fix this pedal for you."
When the bike was fixed, Amy was very happy. She said, "Thank you!" and started to ride her bike. But, something unexpected happened! The bike started to fly in the sky! Amy was scared at first, but then she laughed and said, "This is the most perfect bike ever!"
