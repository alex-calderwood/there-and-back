One day, a little girl named Mia and her friend Max were playing in the park. Mia saw a big tree and said, "I want to give the tree a hug!" Max was envious because he wanted to hug the tree too. He replied, "Wait for me, I want to hug it too!"
As they both ran to the tree to give it a hug, something unexpected happened. The tree began to shake, and a small door opened in the trunk. Mia and Max were very surprised. They looked at each other and decided to go inside the tree.
Inside the tree, they found a magical world full of colors and happy animals. Mia and Max played with the animals and had a great time. The animals were friendly and liked the hugs from the children. At the end of the day, Mia and Max left the tree and went back to their homes. They promised to keep the tree's secret and to visit their new friends again soon.
