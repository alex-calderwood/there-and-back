Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to paint. One day, Lucy found a big, modern bag in her room. She was very happy.
Lucy put all her paints and brushes in the bag. She went to the park with her mom. Lucy saw her friend, Tom, at the park. Tom liked the modern bag and said, "Wow, Lucy! I like your bag!"
Lucy smiled and said, "Thank you, Tom! Do you want to paint with me?" Tom said, "Yes, let's paint!" They both took out their paints and brushes from the bag. They painted pretty pictures all day. They had lots of fun together.
