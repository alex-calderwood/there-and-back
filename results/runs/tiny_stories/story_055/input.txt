One day, a boy named Tim went to his grandma's house. Grandma had a big vase that Tim liked. The vase would stand in the corner of the room. Tim was always careful around the vase.
One day, Tim saw a scary bug near the vase. He ran to his grandma and said, "Grandma, there is a scary bug by the vase!" Grandma told him not to worry, she would take care of the bug.
When Grandma went to get the bug, she saw it was not so scary. It was just a little bug. She told Tim, "See, it's not so scary." Tim felt better and they put the bug outside. From that day on, Tim was not scared of little bugs anymore.
