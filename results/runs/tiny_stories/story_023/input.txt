Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Zigzag, went for a walk. They liked to play in the park. Tim would throw a ball, and Zigzag would run to get it. They were very happy.
One day, a foolish bird was flying around them. The bird said, "Listen, I can fly high in the sky. Can you do that?" Tim looked at the bird and said, "No, I can't fly, but I can run fast with Zigzag."
The bird laughed and flew away. Tim and Zigzag didn't care. They kept playing and having fun. They ran in zigzags all around the park. They knew that they didn't need to fly to be happy. All they needed was each other and their fun games.
