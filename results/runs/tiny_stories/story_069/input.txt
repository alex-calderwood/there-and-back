One day, a boy named Tim was playing with his toy car. He saw a stranger with a big box. The stranger had a brilliant smile. Tim wanted to know what was in the box.
"Hi," said Tim. "What is in the box?" The stranger said, "I have a big number of toys in here. Do you want to see?" Tim was very happy and said, "Yes, please!"
The stranger opened the box, and Tim saw many toys. But then, something unexpected happened. The toys started to fight each other! Tim was scared. He quickly picked up his toy car and ran back to his mom. The stranger and the fighting toys were gone, and Tim learned to be careful with strangers.
