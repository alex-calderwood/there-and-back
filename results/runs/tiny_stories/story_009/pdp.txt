Tim was a young boy who struggled to find a way to stay calm. He would often get anxious and agitated, which led to his mom becoming increasingly concerned about his well-being. Tim's mom wanted to find a way for Tim to relax and ensure that he didn't accidentally knock over the bookcase while he was at home.

One day, Tim was running around the house, having trouble calming down. His mom noticed this and felt a growing sense of urgency to help her son. She knew that if Tim didn't learn to calm down, he might accidentally knock over the bookcase, causing a big mess and possibly getting hurt.

Tim's mom began to brainstorm ways to help her son. She remembered that her friends had found success in using reading as a way to calm their children down. With this in mind, she decided to encourage Tim to sit down and read a book.

Now, the task was to find the perfect book to grab Tim's attention. As Tim continued to run around the house, his mother searched through their collection of books, looking for something that would interest him. After some time, she found a beautifully illustrated book on adventures filled with fascinating stories of knights and dragons. She knew that Tim would love it.

"Tim," she called out, "I found a great book for you to read. It's filled with exciting stories about knights and dragons. I think you'll really enjoy it!"

Tim, curious about the book, slowed down and made his way to his mom. As he started to read the book, he became absorbed in the adventures and stories within the pages. Gradually, his energy levels began to subside, and he started to feel calm.

His mom, relieved and happy to have helped her son, continued to keep an eye on him while she went about her chores. With Tim calmly reading, she felt confident that the bookcase would be safe from any accidents, and so would Tim.

It turned out that finding the right book was all it took for Tim to learn how to find his calm. From that day on, whenever Tim felt agitated or anxious, he would turn to the world of books to help him relax, and their home remained peaceful and bookcase-accident-free.
