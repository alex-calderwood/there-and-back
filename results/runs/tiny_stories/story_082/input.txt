One day, a little pupil named Tim went to school. He saw a big, attractive tree near the playground. Tim loved the tree because it had many pretty leaves and strong branches to climb.
At lunchtime, Tim went to the tree to take a nap. He slept under the tree, and the leaves made a nice shade. While Tim was napping, something unexpected happened. A tiny bird flew down from the tree and landed on Tim's head.
The bird started to sing a sweet song. Tim woke up and saw the bird on his head. He was surprised but happy. The bird became Tim's new friend, and they played together under the attractive tree every day.
