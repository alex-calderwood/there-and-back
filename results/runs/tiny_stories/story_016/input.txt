Once there was a prince. He was very clumsy and loved to talk. He talked to everyone and about everything. But one day he talked too much, and it was to the wrong person. The person was a wicked wizard and the wizard was very mean. He tricked the prince and made him do foolish things. The prince became very sad, and he cried. He realized how important it is to be careful who we talk to. The prince was never happy again. 
The moral of the story is that we should be careful who we talk to, or we may get tricked. People can be mean and it is important to be wise and not careless when talking.
