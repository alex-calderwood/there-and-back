Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a small rabbit named Remy. Remy was different from the other rabbits because he had a very long tail. One day, Remy was playing with his friends when a big, scary wolf came. All the rabbits were very scared and wanted to escape.
Remy said, "Let's start running now!" His friends replied, "Yes, let's escape!" So, Remy and his friends started running as fast as they could. The wolf was very hungry and chased them. Remy's long tail helped him run faster than the other rabbits.
Finally, Remy and his friends found a small hole in the ground. They all jumped in to hide. The wolf could not find them, so he went away. Remy and his friends were safe. They were very happy that Remy's different long tail helped them escape. From that day on, they all played together and had lots of fun.
