In a cozy little house, Lily, an avid reader, was living with her two friends, Friend1 and Friend2. Her house was filled with numerous books and a lovely collection of fragrant soaps. Although she loved reading and smelling her soap collection, the house was anything but organized, which made it difficult for her and her friends to fully enjoy their hobbies.

One day, as they all sat in the cluttered living room, Lily decided that it was time for a change. She declared her intention to organize the house, so they could all enjoy their interests in a pleasant environment. Friend1 and Friend2 were delighted at the thought, so they vowed to help Lily with the project.

Lily began by finding books scattered around the house, uncovering several volumes hidden amongst the chaos. Her friends joined in and brought the books to Lily, who placed them on the shelves. The room started to look more organized, with books neatly arranged and categorized by genre.

As she arranged the books, Lily took a moment to read a passage from her favorite novel. A smile spread across her face as she felt happiness within. Friend1, inspired by Lily's reading, decided to read a section from a book they had recently discovered. The happiness they experienced from reading brightened the atmosphere in the house.

Seeing her friends enjoy their reading, Lily moved on to her soap collection. She put her fragrant soaps on the shelves, mixing their beautiful scents throughout the room. Friend2, noticing the newly arranged soaps, decided to take a whiff of one of them. The scent was so delightful that happiness washed over Friend2, just as it had with the others.

Lily, Friend1, and Friend2 were all happy and satisfied with the now organized house. Their happiness came not only from the organized room but also from the joy they found in their shared love for reading and the appreciation of the delightful scents of Lily's soap collection. Life in the cozy house felt complete, as they cherished their hobbies in a pleasant, organized environment.
