Once upon a time, there was a lonely little boy named Tim. He had no friends to play with. One day, he heard a noise coming from a drawer in his room. Tim was scared, but he wanted to know what was inside.
He opened the drawer and found a small, talking toy named Ben. "Hi, I'm Ben!" said the toy. "I was scared in the drawer all by myself. Will you be my friend?" Tim smiled and said, "Yes, I will be your friend!"
But then, Tim's mean big brother Tom came into the room. He saw Ben and wanted to take him away. Tim was scared, but he stood up to Tom. "No, you can't take Ben! He's my friend!" Tom saw how brave Tim was and decided to leave them alone. Tim and Ben were happy and never felt lonely again.
