One day, a boy named Tim found an unusual toy in his yard. It was a rocket! Tim was very happy. He picked up the rocket and ran to his friend, Sue.
Tim showed Sue the unusual rocket. Sue liked it too. They decided to play with the rocket near the swing in the park. They took turns swinging and flying the rocket in the air.
As they played, the rocket flew higher and higher. It went so high that it touched the sky! Tim and Sue laughed and clapped. They loved their new unusual rocket and the fun it brought to their swing playtime.
