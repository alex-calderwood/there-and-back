Once upon a time, there was a big boat. The boat could sail on the water. One day, a man wanted to sail the big boat. The man was a thief. He was not nice.
The thief found it difficult to sail the boat. He saw a little girl by the water. The little girl knew how to sail. The thief asked the little girl, "Can you help me sail the big boat?" The little girl said, "Yes, I can help you."
The little girl helped the thief sail the big boat. They sailed far away. The thief learned to be nice. He said, "Thank you for helping me." The little girl was happy. They both sailed the big boat together and had fun.
