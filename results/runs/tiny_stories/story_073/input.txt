Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to play chess with her big sister, Mia. They played chess every day after school. The chess pieces were very shiny. Lucy liked how they shined in the sunlight.
One day, Lucy felt uncomfortable. Her tummy hurt a lot. She did not want to play chess that day. Mia was sad, but she wanted Lucy to feel better. So, Mia put the shiny chess pieces away and sat with Lucy.
They sat by the window together. The sun was shining brightly outside. Lucy started to feel better. She smiled at Mia and said, "Let's play chess again tomorrow!" Mia was happy and agreed. They knew the shiny chess pieces would be waiting for them.
