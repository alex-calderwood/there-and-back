Lily and her mom had a special day planned. They were going to the carnival. They had been looking forward to it for weeks. 
When they got there, they saw a big machine that said 'weigh and win.' Lily looked at the machine with big eyes. She wanted to play so badly. She begged her mom to let her play.
"Okay sweetie," said her mom. "But be very modest."
Lily was so excited. She hopped onto the machine and waited to be weighed. When the machine read her weight, Lily was disappointed. It read 'weight too low.'
Lily started crying. Her mom tried to comfort her. But it was no use. Lily was too upset.
"Oh Lily," said her mom. "It was too bad you didn't get to play. I'm sorry."
The special day Lily and her mom had been waiting for was ruined.
