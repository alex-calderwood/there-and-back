Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot liked to play with his toys. One day, Spot found a big stack of blocks. He wanted to make the stack taller and taller.
Spot started to worry when the stack got very tall. He thought it might fall down. Spot did not want the stack to be bad. He wanted it to be the best stack ever.
Just then, Spot's friend, a little cat named Fluffy, came to help. Fluffy showed Spot how to make the stack strong and not fall. Spot and Fluffy worked together and made the best stack ever. They were very happy and played together all day.
