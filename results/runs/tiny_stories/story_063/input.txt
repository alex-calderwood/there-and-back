One day, a big red apple was in the tree. A slow ant saw the apple and wanted to eat it. The ant went up the tree to get the apple.
The ant said, "I want to eat this big red apple." The ant tried to enter the apple to eat it. But the apple was too hard for the ant to go in.
Then, a bird came and said, "I can help you, ant." The bird hit the apple with its beak. The apple fell and broke. The ant was happy and said, "Thank you, bird!" The ant and the bird shared the apple and ate it together.
