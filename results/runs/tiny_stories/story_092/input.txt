Once upon a time, a little boy named Dan was very worried. He wanted to go to university when he grew up but he was scared he wouldn't be able to make it.
One day, he got a letter in the mail. It said he had been accepted to university! Dan was so happy he couldn't believe it. He ran around the house, clapping and laughing. 
When his mom saw Dan so happy, she stopped what she was doing and applauded too. She was so proud of Dan for his hard work. Soon the whole family was applauding and cheering for Dan's achievement.
Dan was so excited to start university and finally have his dreams come true! He was no longer worried about it. He knew that with hard work, he would be able to make his dreams a reality.
