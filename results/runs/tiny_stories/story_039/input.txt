Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a cap that he loved very much. He would rub the cap every day because it was his favorite thing.
One day, Tim found it difficult to find his cap. He looked everywhere. He looked under his bed, in his toy box, and even in the kitchen. But he could not find it. Tim was very sad.
Then, Tim's dog, Spot, came running into the room. Spot had the cap in his mouth! Tim was so happy to see his cap. But when he took it, he found out it was not his cap. It was a new cap with a picture of a big, funny dog. Tim laughed and put on the new cap. He loved it even more than his old one.
