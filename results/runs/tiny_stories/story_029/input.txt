One day, a big red ball was in the garage. A little boy named Tim went in to play with it. He saw the ball near a big box. Tim ran to the ball and started to play.
As he played, he heard a loud noise. "What was that?" Tim asked his mom. "I don't know," she said, "let's go see." They went to the back of the garage and saw a small bird on the ground. It did not move. "Oh no, the bird is dead," said Tim's mom.
Suddenly, the bird opened its eyes and stood up. It was not dead after all! The bird had just fallen from its nest. Tim and his mom were happy. They helped the bird back to its nest and continued to play with the big red ball.
