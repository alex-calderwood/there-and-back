Sara was happy. She had a new dog. His name was Spot. He was black and white and very soft. Sara liked to hug him and play with him.
One day, Sara and Spot went to the park. They saw many other dogs and people. Spot ran and jumped and barked. Sara laughed and clapped. She felt proud of her new dog.
Then, Sara saw a boy. He was bigger than her. He had a red ball. He threw the ball and his dog chased it. His dog was big and brown and loud. Sara felt scared of his dog.
"Hi, I'm Tom. What's your name?" the boy asked Sara.
"I'm Sara. This is Spot," Sara said, holding her dog close.
"Can I pet your dog? He looks nice," Tom said, smiling.
Sara felt shy. She did not know Tom. She did not know if Spot liked him. She looked at her dog. Spot wagged his tail and licked Tom's hand. Sara felt happy. Spot liked Tom.
"Sure, you can pet him. He is very soft," Sara said, letting go of her dog.
Tom petted Spot and threw his ball. Spot ran after it and brought it back. Tom and Sara played with their dogs. They felt glad. They made new friends.
