One day, a girl named Amy found a smooth drum in her room. She did not know where it came from. She touched the drum and it made a fun sound. Amy liked the drum and wanted to show it to her friend, Tom.
Amy took the drum to Tom's house. She said, "Tom, look at my drum!" Tom looked at the drum and touched it. He said, "Wow, it is very smooth!" They played with the drum and made happy sounds.
One day, they found a note with the drum. It said, "When you play this drum, something will shrink." They did not know what it meant. They played the drum, and Tom's toy car shrank! They were surprised but happy. Now, they had a magic drum that could shrink things!
