Lily was a shy girl and lived next to Tim, a boy her age. They often saw each other playing in their backyards but had never spoken to each other. In Lily's possession, there was a big, red ball that she loved playing with.

One sunny day, as Lily was playing with her big red ball, she noticed Tim looking at her from his backyard. Lily decided to seize the opportunity and try to make friends with him. She rolled the ball towards him, and Tim, surprised but delighted, took the ball and smiled at Lily.

With this simple act, Lily and Tim became friends, and they began playing together in their backyards. They had so much fun tossing the big red ball back and forth, laughing and chatting about everything under the sun. Lily noticed that she felt happier than ever before when she played with Tim, and Tim felt the same way.

As the days went by, playing with the big red ball became their favorite pastime. They always looked forward to their playtime and the happy moments they shared. The big red ball had not only brought them happiness but had also forged a beautiful friendship between them that would last a lifetime.
