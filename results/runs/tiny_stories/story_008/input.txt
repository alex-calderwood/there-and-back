Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily had an interesting toy. It was a big, red ball. She played with the ball every day.
One day, Lily met a new friend named Tim. Tim saw the ball and said, "Wow! That's a big, red ball. Can I play with it?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, we can play together!"
Lily and Tim played with the ball all day. They had so much fun. When the day had to end, they were sad. But they knew they would always have the memory of playing with the big, red ball. And they were happy they became friends.
