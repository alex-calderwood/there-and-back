A curious boy was walking in the park. He saw a big tree and he pointed at it. He wanted to explore! He started walking around the tree. Soon he noticed something on the ground. It was a small egg! He was so excited because he had never seen one before. He reached down and picked it up, then he showed it to his mom. His mom smiled and said, "Look at the egg you found!" The boy was so happy and he started to jump around with the egg in his hands. He looked at the egg closely and wondered what it was going to be when it grew up. He was so curious and he just wanted to know more about this egg he found in the park.
