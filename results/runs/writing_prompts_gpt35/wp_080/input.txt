" At first it was shocking, but then it became normal, " said Molly. She was young for a centaur and I wondered how she ended up in the mines. She swung her pickaxe at the rock wall, dislodging a large chunk of ore. Tossing the pick aside, she wrapped her four arms around the chunk and tossed it in a minecart. A loose strand of hair fell across her sweaty forehead. She paused and examined the two arms attached to her rib cage. " Besides, once my sentence is done, they will remove the extra arms. "

" Does it. . . does it hurt? "

She shook her head. " Not really, although you 'll be sore for the first week—but you 'll probably be sore anyway. You ever worked in a mine before? "

" No. I worked in the palace my whole life. " I tried to swing my pick at the wall but it bounced off the rock with a clang. The reverberation hurt my hands and I flinched.

" You have to find the loose spots, here— " Molly scraped at the wall, revealing a long crack in the rock. " Try it there. "

I swung again. My pick sank easily into the cracks. I pulled on the shaft and dislodged a small cascade of dust and stones.

" There you go ! " Molly smiled. " What did you do, before? "

" I. . . " I opened my mouth but no answer came. What do I tell this woman? That I was a handmaiden to the princess herself? That I had been her best friend? Maybe hHer only friend? That I had been imprisoned for daring to resist her brother's advances?

" It's ok, sweetie—you don't have to talk about it. We 're all the same down here anyway. "

" No, it's alright. I. . . stole some food in the market. " The lie felt awkward in my mouth. Truth and fiction had never been an issue, before. My life had been laundry and bathing and tea times, sewing and cleaning.

Molly frowned. " Wow, they must be getting stricter. I 've never met a simple thief in the mines before. "

" The famine is getting worse, " I offered. In truth, I had never been outside the palace walls. I had no idea how people lived in the city, but I had heard two of the guards discussing the food shortage.

'Well, once you 've got your arms, you 'll get as much food as you need to work. " She wiped her face with one hand. " In fact, I could use a snack. Can you run up to the waystation and get us some apples? "

I nodded and laid my pickaxe against the wall. I hurried up the narrow tunnel. Just as I approached the torchlights of the waystation, a voice hissed at me. I turned. A small goblin beckoned to me from a small hole in the wall.

" You ! You 're from the palace. "

" Y-yes? "

" Do n't believe the horse woman. " The goblin cupped one ear and listened. Hearing nothing, he continued. " She works for them, girl. They send her the new ones, before. . . the change. "

I shuddered. " I don't want more arms. I shouldn't even be down here. "

The goblin smiled maliciously. " There are worse things than arms, girl. Much worse. "

The goblin and I turned at the sound of clopping horsefeet. " She's coming, " he hissed. " Remember—don't trust her. "

I turned to go but the goblin grabbed my arm and pulled me close. " You aren't alone down here, handmaiden. Not everyone in these mines is a pawn of the prince. "

I tried to pull away, my fingers prying at the goblin's hand, but his fingers dug into my flesh. The clopping grew nearer. " Please, you 're hurting me. "

" Do not lose hope, girl, no matter what they do to you. " He glanced down the tunnel. " There's a war coming. A revolution. "

He released my hand and faded into the shadows as Molly turned the corner. I waved to her and smiled.

" We need you, girl. Stay alive. "

I look back at the hole but the goblin is gone.
