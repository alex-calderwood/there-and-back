                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

                "content": "<|Story|>\nWe did it. Me and my two friends created a 100 % death calculator. It showed when you would die and why, and most importantly, if it was avoidable. \" Let's test it dude ! \", Pat said. He was at it before I couldn't stop him. \" Late eighties, cause is age and is unavoidable. \", he said, monotone yet cheerfully. \" My turn ! \", said Stephen. He got similar results. I went last.\n\nI put my hand on the scanner. The results printed. They said : \" Five minutes from now, cause is mutilation, avoidable if logic is used. Recommended action : lock door now. \" \" What the fuck? \", I said. \" Uhh. . I probably screwed some code up. \", Pat said. We sat there for about out four minutes arguing over what to do, arguing over whether to heed the advice, or to ignore it. \" Need some food. \", Stephen said, \" Lets head down. \"\n\nWe stepped out of the room and began to head downstairs. We heard a knock on the front door from the top of the stairwell. \" Probably my parents. \", I said. They wee out for the day, and just came back. I was excited to tell them that my death calculator actually worked. \" Where 'd you 're parents go? \", Pat asked. \" They left an hour ago for IKEA. \", I responded. I took a step downstairs. \" That was fast. IKEA is far as hell. Took my parents five hours. \", Pat said. That's when it hit me.\n\nIKEA took about five hours to get to from where I live. My parents left and hour ago. All of a sudden, they 're back?\n\n\" Stop. \", I said. \" Remember the death calculator? \", I said. I didn't have to finish, we put two and two together fast. We charged back to my room and bolted the door shut. \" Calm down, no need to stomp. \", Stephen said. \" We 're safe, I think. You know, the whole logic thing and how to avoid it? \", he said, panting. \" Point made, but what stomping. . . \" \" What the hell is that? \", I asked. We all heard an extremely loud stomping sound coming from downstairs. Whoever it was, was stomping extremely fast. Too fast. Humans didn't stomp that fast. Suddenly, it stopped. \" What the fuck? What do we do? \", I said. Stephen was about to say something when I hear four loud knocks on the room door. I was pumping adrenaline after what I heard next. In an inhuman voice, whatever the fuck on the other side of the door said, \" Cmon, open the door. Let's play. I can't come in unless you unlock it. \" The voice was not human.\n\nWe stood there, contemplating on what to do. \" The calculator said to use logic, so we shouldn't open the door under any circumstances. \", Pat said. \" Now what? \", I 'm not setting here with whatever the fuck that thing is. \", I said. \" Well, it would technically make sense to call 911. \", Stephen said. Pat's phone was charged, he immediately dialed the number. As he was about to hit call, we started hearing breathing on the other side of the door. Then, three loud knocks. Then, screaming : \" LET ME IN ! LET ME IN ! \". Then in a calm voice : \" Let me in. \". It alternated between calm and loud voices. \" Do not fucking go near that door. \", Pat said, \" The cops are coming. \"\n\nWe heard more knocks, but this time, from downstairs. We heard the sound of braking wood. \" Calvary is here ! \", I said. \" Wait till they get here. \", Stephen said. We heard there knocks on our door. \" Police, open up. \", I opened it.\n\nWe stepped out. No creature. But we did find scratch marks all over the house, along with visible footsteps on the carpet. It didn't have toes, it looked like, paws.\n\nPolice never found any evidence of whatever entered my home. We tried the death calculator again, it said : death averted ; new results : \" time until death is 7 days, cause is multiplication, avoidable if weapons used. Recommended action : follow directions of military officer. \" Just then, a man wearing army fatigues came in to my room and said, \" You boys will need to follow me, everything will be fine, just stay calm. \""
