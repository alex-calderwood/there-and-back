We did it. Me and my two friends created a 100 % death calculator. It showed when you would die and why, and most importantly, if it was avoidable. " Let's test it dude ! ", Pat said. He was at it before I couldn't stop him. " Late eighties, cause is age and is unavoidable. ", he said, monotone yet cheerfully. " My turn ! ", said Stephen. He got similar results. I went last.

I put my hand on the scanner. The results printed. They said : " Five minutes from now, cause is mutilation, avoidable if logic is used. Recommended action : lock door now. " " What the fuck? ", I said. " Uhh. . I probably screwed some code up. ", Pat said. We sat there for about out four minutes arguing over what to do, arguing over whether to heed the advice, or to ignore it. " Need some food. ", Stephen said, " Lets head down. "

We stepped out of the room and began to head downstairs. We heard a knock on the front door from the top of the stairwell. " Probably my parents. ", I said. They wee out for the day, and just came back. I was excited to tell them that my death calculator actually worked. " Where 'd you 're parents go? ", Pat asked. " They left an hour ago for IKEA. ", I responded. I took a step downstairs. " That was fast. IKEA is far as hell. Took my parents five hours. ", Pat said. That's when it hit me.

IKEA took about five hours to get to from where I live. My parents left and hour ago. All of a sudden, they 're back?

" Stop. ", I said. " Remember the death calculator? ", I said. I didn't have to finish, we put two and two together fast. We charged back to my room and bolted the door shut. " Calm down, no need to stomp. ", Stephen said. " We 're safe, I think. You know, the whole logic thing and how to avoid it? ", he said, panting. " Point made, but what stomping. . . " " What the hell is that? ", I asked. We all heard an extremely loud stomping sound coming from downstairs. Whoever it was, was stomping extremely fast. Too fast. Humans didn't stomp that fast. Suddenly, it stopped. " What the fuck? What do we do? ", I said. Stephen was about to say something when I hear four loud knocks on the room door. I was pumping adrenaline after what I heard next. In an inhuman voice, whatever the fuck on the other side of the door said, " Cmon, open the door. Let's play. I can't come in unless you unlock it. " The voice was not human.

We stood there, contemplating on what to do. " The calculator said to use logic, so we shouldn't open the door under any circumstances. ", Pat said. " Now what? ", I 'm not setting here with whatever the fuck that thing is. ", I said. " Well, it would technically make sense to call 911. ", Stephen said. Pat's phone was charged, he immediately dialed the number. As he was about to hit call, we started hearing breathing on the other side of the door. Then, three loud knocks. Then, screaming : " LET ME IN ! LET ME IN ! ". Then in a calm voice : " Let me in. ". It alternated between calm and loud voices. " Do not fucking go near that door. ", Pat said, " The cops are coming. "

We heard more knocks, but this time, from downstairs. We heard the sound of braking wood. " Calvary is here ! ", I said. " Wait till they get here. ", Stephen said. We heard there knocks on our door. " Police, open up. ", I opened it.

We stepped out. No creature. But we did find scratch marks all over the house, along with visible footsteps on the carpet. It didn't have toes, it looked like, paws.

Police never found any evidence of whatever entered my home. We tried the death calculator again, it said : death averted ; new results : " time until death is 7 days, cause is multiplication, avoidable if weapons used. Recommended action : follow directions of military officer. " Just then, a man wearing army fatigues came in to my room and said, " You boys will need to follow me, everything will be fine, just stay calm. "
