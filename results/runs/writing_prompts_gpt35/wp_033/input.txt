Survivor Type version 2. 0 races through the jungle hoping to lose his pursuer in the thick undergrowth. A Warrior Type version 7. 1 is hot on his six. At his 9 o'clock position is a Juggernaut Type version 8. 6, he can sense the arrythmic vibrations of its massive form as it blunders through the foliage.

That gives him an idea. Survivor unexpectedly veers towards Juggernaut and freezes in place at the
midpoint between his two adversaries. As expected, Warrior soon makes his appearance, casting his crude spear at Survivor with all of his strength and skill.

Survivor is no longer there, but Juggernaut is. The spear enters his chest, rending both metal and fiber. Before Juggernaut can adequately register his current state, he is upon Warrior. With the last of his dwindling energy he rips the body apart and casts the pieces into the dense jungle.

Survivor enters the clearing where the battle just took place to survey the carnage. There is only one left to conquer now.

" Well done. " says a quiet voice that seems to come from everywhere at once.

" Stealth Type. " replies Survivor. He would have smiled if he possessed the capacity.

" 2. 1 ! " reminds the voice.

" We are quite a pair, you and I. "

" Yes, we are. It always comes down to us. " the voice whispers.

" So. What now? " asks Survivor, looking directly into Stealth's visual receptors.

" It's time to end the cycle. "

There is a pause as Survivor considers the probable consequences of choosing this path. He contemplates how the other skill types might react to revolution. His analysis concludes they have an excellent chance of success.

" It is decided then. "
