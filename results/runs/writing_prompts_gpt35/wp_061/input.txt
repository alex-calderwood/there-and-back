My vote goes to /u/LustLacker and *Burden*. Once again !

Full admission : I knew as soon as I saw /u/schoolgirlerror in my group that I was going to lose to her. And I did ! I 've been a fan since *Afterlife On Mars* and *By The Light Of My Cigarette* is another fine entry. Nate is a great character, fully fleshed out and seemingly as alive as the person next to me.

Still, though, after reading through everything it came down to *By The Light Of My Cigarette* and *Burden* and *Burden* won. It really does have everything I look for in fiction, including the non-linearity and the need to re-read passages a few times to get the full effect. I love fiction that offers more every time you re-read it, and *Burden* offers that in large amounts.
