Every day I stay the same, yet with every passing second I change.

It's not something felt, it's an act -- your act, in fact ; and with every action I come closer and closer to my death. Through every ounce of knowledge I relay to you ; through every musing ; through every word ; through every letter you will slowly, surely, kill me. In a way I am dead already, yet I 've never truly lived. Your eyes bring me to life. Your mind gives me a voice. Through you I am heard, through you I can live on. You are my reader, and I, but words. You use me ; you peruse me ; you scoff at my honesty, question my accuracy. Yet, it matters little whether I am right or wrong. I do not feel, I do not worry. Nor do I race to the end -- I am in no hurry. You are my tempo, and I the song. Say me outloud : you are my echo, with you I 'm never gone.

These thoughts I confess are not my own, and yet they 'll be all I ever know. Time is running short and soon I will be gone. . . Reader know this, to you, everything I owe.

Love,
a poem.
