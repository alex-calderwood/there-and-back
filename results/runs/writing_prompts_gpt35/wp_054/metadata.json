                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

                "content": "<|Story|>\n\". . . a visitor \" the old priest murmured.\n\nI neatly palmed the crucifix into my jacket pocket and kept walking. The weight in my chest was heavier than the little wood in my pocket. A visitor.\n\nAcross the street the Auxiliaries sat there watching. I did my best not to look them in the eyes, afraid they 'd see the hate that lived in mine. Any gathering of Catholics was a threat to them, and Mass doubly so. I had no doubt that a few members of the parish were informers. Confession isn't just a sacrament.\n\nI took the long way down Francis Street to the Liffey. Every few corners I 'd pass another group of soldiers or a constable and it felt as if the crucifix would burn a hole right through my coat. We hoped that if they found it when I was searched it would be ignored, or at least abused no differently than usual. If they kenned its secrets, prayer would do me very little good.\n\nCrossing the river, I made my way to the simple town home I shared with two other families. Reliable people, we thought, who wouldn't take much notice of my visitor this evening. Still, I drew the shades down tight, and pushed the table in front of the door before I dared reach into my pocket.\n\nI twisted the little figurine clockwise until it clicked. The spring inside pushed out a sliver of paper wrapped in a tight cylinder. I was always in awe of these little toys. . . the clever detail that deliberate hands had crafted. The same hands that might make a windup train for your kids or fix your father's watch. I rarely went into any of the jewelers ' shops, but I knew that somewhere in the city was another brave man fighting the struggle with those delicate hands.\n\nMy hands aren't for building things, but for breaking them.\n\nI took the scrap of paper and unrolled it. Three red exes greeted me. Assassinations. Three men to kill. I took it over to the tiny brass candle tray and held it before the flame. In the heat the date 6 April 15 appeared before me. Swearing, I let the paper burn and then snuffed the candle. Two days. Two days !\n\nOnce I was sure all the pieces were burnt, I scraped the table away from the door and stepped cautiously into the garden. The high fence kept out inquiring eyes from the neighbors, and I had the only room that looked down into this little patch behind my home.\n\nThere in the yard was a cistern covered with a large flat rock. I stuck my arm down nearly to the elbow and felt along the underside of the well until I found the familiar rope. Gently, slowly, I pulled up the bucket with its oilskin bag. Hunched over the hole I was careful not to bring the bucket up any further than I had to. I reached in and felt the familiar weight of my Webley double action revolver. A sympathetic, or at least enterprising, quartermaster with the RIC had let a case of these go missing two years ago, and the boys had spread them around to the men of action like myself.\n\nI took a box of cartridges too, deftly slipping the gun and rounds into my pocket that had so recently held the crucifix. Neatly, I lowered the barrel back down the hole and replaced the rock. A few quick scuffs of dirt and it looked as if it had never been disturbed. With a furtive glance about the yard, I returned to my home.\n\nI spent the next few hours cleaning the gun, preparing the speed loader, and feeling the satisfying click click click of the action as I pulled the trigger. Satisified, I loaded it and snapped it shut. With its reassuring weight in my belt, I finished a quiet meal and waited for the knock on my door.\n\nA visitor was coming to see me, one of the men who decides who lives and who dies. I never ask why, and I never fail to complete my mission. Four men are sitting at supper somewhere in the city, and in within fourth-eight hours three of us would be dead."
