                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

His teeth stung as he sucked air down into his lungs and almost unconsciously he dug his fingers into his thigh until it was no more.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, *thighs*.\n\nIt was almost a miracle he had survived thus far -- one person could only stay hidden for so long. The windows were his biggest contender, what with every human's need for vitamin D and his particular affinity for basking in the warm daylight.\n\nDazed, he glanced up at the window and one corner of his mouth twitched as he spotted a crow perched on the delapidated tree planted purposefully right outside his wall.\n\nApollo was always right. The crow shrieked. One lone black wing sank to the grass.\n\nWith a whoosh, feathers pierced through his darkening skin and erupted into ruffled plumage. For a brief moment he choked and then he found himself perched upon the ground, wings spread and beak parted.\n\nFreedom could only ever be found in others -- an ironic twist in the land of the free -- and for now, Andrew sought it out in the pain of that which was foolish enough to find his window to the world. This was left for the human mind though, the very mind which was now buried deep beneath the crow's. The crow sought the sun, and the sun it would have.\n\nUpon landing, he folded his wings and preened. His claws clicked idly on the mahogany desk, leaving tiny prints in the manila envelopes and white cardstock that littered the surface. The countdown began.\n\nThe sun warmed his feathers. His beady eyes focused on the ants that paraded through a crack in the wall. A flash of light danced around the room for a brief second. The countdown ended.\n\nAs quickly as it came, it left, and the crow mind vanished as the feathers retreated back into the ashen skin from which they came.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, *waist*.\n\nH groaned, choking on the pain that inched up his spine and threaded its way through his skull. This was it, his last moments, and he couldn't even get off his desk.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, *chest*.\n\nSuddenly breathing was impossible and as the last shreds of consciousness crawled their way out of his skull, Andrew slammed his hand onto the desk.\n\n\" Mr. President? \" The woman stood at the entrance to the room, a closed fist to her chest. Her frown slowly raised and with one step she was within the room.\n\nToes. Toes, ankles. Toes, ankles, calves. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, chest. Toes, ankles, calves, thighs, waist, chest, *life*.\n\n\n\" That 'll be Ms. President, now. \" Her hand opened and a black feather fluttered idly to the ground."
