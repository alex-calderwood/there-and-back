Never shall I know

Solitary connection,

Shared inner glow,

Nor sweet perfection.

Irrational love

Has irrational means.

& nbsp ;

Yet rational proof,

Had conquered the set.

A term carried,

And connected to rest.

Each wanderer found

And love expressed.

& nbsp ;

But where is my solution?

I am incomplete.

Though all might find others,

Perfect, replete,

I am lost to the footnotes,

The empty set's sweet.

& nbsp ;

Could I differentiate?

It would be futile to deceive

In a search for a prime.

I will never receive

My integral partner

To limit my sieve.

& nbsp ;

I am fated,

In a world of pairs.

This universe carries,

A truth unfair :

An odd one out

Will never be sated.

& nbsp ;

^^QED.
