                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

The storm coming is almost overwhelming, a wall of wind and thunder bearing down upon my motley band of mercenaries and myself.\n\nBut it's the storm within the storm I 'm most afraid of. We form the vanguard of the retreating Western Soldatis Imperial Army, placed here as a stopgap against the Night Horde. A speedbump, I think wryly to myself as the first blast of driving rain crashes into us, flashes of lightning revealing ghostly images of the Night Horde within, tattered banners of fallen legions waving madly in the wind.\n\nThe front rank shudders. They know this mission is suicide. I move up and down the rank on Selenmare, mud splashing up from her hooves already, the ground slick. But she's used to that, though typically it's the slick of blood.\n\n\" Men, \" I shout to make myself heard over the thunder, \" I promised you treasure and fame ! \"\n\nThere is an uncomfortable shuffling. My men are here as a courtesy to me at this point, wavering, ready to flee. No mercenary truly wants to lay down their lives.\n\n\" I know this struggle seems fruitless. . . \" there are a few murmurings of assent \" but today I fulfill that promise. \"\n\nCuriosity, now, and I fumble in my robe. For one sickening lurching instant I think I reach for nothing, but then I will it to be where it ought to and I pull the Sunstone free. Blazing light pierces the darkness, and the rain even seems to abate a little, a beam of sunlight reaching through the clouds like a ray of dawn.\n\nThe men gawk. \" I thought the Sunstone was destroyed in the marshes of Guildor ! \" my lieutenant says, astonished.\n\nI smile and wink.\n\n\" I made it appear as such, or it would never stop being hunted for. \"\n\n\" Now, \" I say, with hard eyes and renewed determination. \" Today we were meant to hold the line, meant to die to buy the Soldatis some time. But I say we go one further. We rout the Night Horde, here, at Greienmar pass. We take their plunder for ourselves, and when the Soldatis army returns with its tail between its legs we arrive shortly after with victory in our breath ! \"\n\nThe men cheer, and I wheel around to face the Night Horde. At its head stands Chalcedon, my old foe, his ancient and daemonic armor making him stick out like a sore thumb amongst his horde, oozing darkness like a wound in the world. He raises his arm. Anticipation thickens the air. He lowers it and a cavalcade of arrows darkens the sky.\n\nI hold the sunstone aloft and the arrows are burned away.\n\n\" CHAAAAAARGE, \" I scream, leading the way. My men, screaming likewise, follow.\n\nThen I wake up.\n\n\" Motherfucker, every time, \" I mutter to myself as I sit up in bed. The morning routine follows, as it does every morning, except Saturdays wherein I wake up at 10:30 rather than 8 and Sundays where I awaken at 11.\n\nShower. Shave. Brush teeth. Put on pants, tuck in shirt, consider which of my two belts I 'll wear today. Pick up two bottled waters for work.\n\nI trudge towards the office. I 'm early, a little, today, and the dreaming has left me tired. I stop at my favorite coffee shop, why not.\n\nChalcedon asks me if I want sugar.\n\nWhat.\n\nChalcedon repeats the question.\n\nHe's wearing his armor. His voice still sounds like crushing gravel and bone. Vaguely, I try to will him away. Must still be dreaming.\n\nHe smiles. It makes me feel filthy, like I 've been drenched in vomit.\n\n\" I see you 've seen through my disguise, but as always I brush aside your feeble magicks. \"\n\nI gawk, barely managing to duck aside as the counter more-or-less explodes, Chalcedon striding through it even as he draws his mighty blade. I realize, slowly, that the coffee shop is empty of all but I and my dream nemesis.\n\n\" I had hoped to end this quickly, with a touch of poison, but it seems that I am weaker in your world also, \" Chalcedon grunts.\n\n\" But cease to dream, now, and trouble me no longer, \" he says, raising his blade.\n\n**Shit. **"
