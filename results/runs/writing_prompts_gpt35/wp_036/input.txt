Light is one of the features of the universe the universe that would be, needless to say, difficult to live without. It's what lets us see, it's what transfers energy to our plants, so they can grow and we can eat them, it gives us electricity when in contact with solar panels, you know the drill. Which is why I was so excited when I came into my own power : the ability to create light. That is, until I found the catch while seeing how far I could take it, hoping I could shoot light blasts or hurl mini-stars. Turns out, I couldn't take it very far at all : I could make spheres of light, about as bright as a particularly aggressive ember, one millimeter thick, and hold it in place, anchored in relation to something else, for as long as I wanted. One was easy, any more and it took some concentration. Even with as many as I could summon in short notice, it wasn't even enough to light up a room ; I was a discount nightlight, at best. I, naturally, maintained this belief, until an off topic rant in my senior year of physics in college led to, pun fully intended, a spark of inspiration.

Light and heat are fundamentally connected : light is, essentially, energy, as is heat, and light and heat can do lots of things, in high enough quantities. So, I raided my dorm room for supplies, went to the workshop, and got crafting. Not long after, I emerged with a little insulated box, a couple inches long, with a button to open one end, and mirrors inside on all edges. Hoping against hope, I anchored a spark dead-center in the box, set it in a nice, cool place, and waited. And waited, and waited, and waited. After my patience finally wore out, I grabbed the encouragingly warm box one night, and headed to a secluded little area of the grounds, and pulled the trigger. Out shot a brief, but wonderfully bright, beam of light. The resulting fires were alarming and exciting, all at once, but don't worry, I put them out.

Months later, bach degree attained, multiple lightboxes stored and charging, I was known, and I was feared. It may not have been the most straightforward way, but I got by light beams in the end, and they can be more than strong enough, with enough time.
