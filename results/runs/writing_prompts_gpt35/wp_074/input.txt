Dear Bill,

It took a lot of time for me to realize what you are, and now that I do I can't seem to think of words that describe how I feel about you being in my life.

Did you know that, growing up, other kids don't periodically put their dogs in the freezer for fun? Or spend countless hours drowning mice in the basement? It's amazing Mom and Dad never found out about you, especially after you killed the McInley's cat.

I used to wonder why throughout school we never had really close friends. I mean obviously we had friends, more than most kids, but they were never close friends. It was the same thing with girlfriends. I consistently thought there was something wrong with me, and I guess there was : you. You manipulated everyone to feed your unhealthy obsession with us, and kept me emotionally isolated so I wouldn't get in your way.

As we 've grown older we 've grown apart and I thought I was rid of you after basic, but that was just another part of your scheme. What better place could there be for you to thrive than the military, and you used me to get you through the training. That was a mistake however, as it has made me just capable enough to cut you off from the people you wo n't even let me love. I 'm going to do it Bill, and you can't stop me.

Dear Mom and Dad, I 'm sorry for having been so cold. I thought I hated you, and maybe I do, but I 'd like to think it was just Bill's influence. I wish I could say I love you but if I did, none of this would be necessary. All I can say is crack on, and focus on Chloe and Jake.

I think I 've found the words, Bill. I fundamentally despise you. I hate you in an intimate way that most other people don't understand. Most other people don't have the relationship we do. It's because of you that I 'll never be able to have a normal life, with other people. It's your arrogant and insecure thoughts that influence every decision I make. It's your fault that I don't feel a connection to other people. I 've done my research and there's no treatment for you, only pretending to be normal. But I don't take pleasure in a facade like you, and I 'm not so self centred as to drag this despairing monologue out further. If you will force me into a future of self-loathing, fear, and alienation. . . if you take my future from me, then I 'll do the same to you.

Here's to you, asshole.
