The silence was overwhelming. It seemed like a lifetime ago that I was standing on the edge of my condo disgusted with the decisions I 've made with my short life. I remember falling and regret, all my problems shrunk in severity as the ground raced towards me, then silence. The darkness I felt slowly started to change as I realized that the plane of existence I 'm in was changing. Colors i 've never seen before engulfed my mind and eased my worry almost immediately. Slowly I drifted through each color completely at ease. As I drifted I began to understand the nature of life. It's not about a checklist of achievements or accomplishments, I understood now that life was about spending your time enjoying the things you love and the people that make you happy. I felt elation, I felt as if I was a part of everything I knew and loved. I was now a cog in the machine of our universe, awestruck by the beauty of the afterlife.

A twinge of grey overtook the color, and suddenly I was dragged away out of my beautiful tapestry of the most spectacular thing I have ever seen, felt, or even imagined. I was immediately drawn back into the black. A steady rhythm filled my mind. Beep. . . Beep. . . Beep. . . The air smelled pungent and my body felt heavy. Beep. . . Beep. . . Beep. . . I opened my eyes to a crowd of unfamiliar faces, crowding around my bed furiously scribbling down what appears to be important information. The doctor mumbles something about 67 days as I reconcile with the fact that this room is so grey and lifeless. The next few days were a blur of crying family and interviews as the media reported on my " Resurrection ". I answered their questions honestly, yet in the back of my mind all I could think about was that beautiful tapestry I was a part of. The world seems much colder now, even the allure of my own definition of living a good life faded with the dreary idea that I was missing out on something much bigger, much more important. So Here I stand on top of my condominium again. This time I ask that you let me stay.
