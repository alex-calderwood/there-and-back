                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

They built giant machines that could fart and used the farts to. . . propel themselves. . . into space? \" Qlorog could not believe the reports coming in. Even with AI-assist at 5, Qlorog was at a loss. Qlala must be explaining it wrong. Qlorog was not an engineer, but any lifelong fleeter knows how ships work.\n\" *Nuclear* farts ! \" Qlala answered with a laugh. Qlorog boosted the AI-assist to 6, activating visi-hook, but the visualization could not be right. These people just aim their nuclear fart machine and slingshot through space? This sounded like a child's crazy story, not the work of a space faring species. How do they even pindrop their blinks? Qlorog had seen all sorts of different wrecks in his 13 years working *WTF Is That* duty in the Illar 4 sector. The occasional search and recovery missions were exciting in their own way, particularly since Qlala had joined the team, but discovering impossible technology filled with strange beings was the stuff of science fiction. Most of his missions consisted of detecting an unidentified rock and identifying it as a rock. Qlorog liked it that way. \" That's not even the crazy part, \" Qlala added, excited in only the way a xenobiology minor would be in the face of a first contact crisis, \" It looks like they 've been in there for hundreds of years ! \" Qlorog spit out his data receptor in shock. Quickly scrambling to reconnect, \" What? \" he transmitted, even before the spindle had rehooked into his visual cortex. \" I don't even know where to begin, \" Qlala continued without missing a beat. \" We were able to detect hundreds of lifeforms in stasis from 300 qqolas away, no FTL, no blinkfolds, no *shields*. This thing at best hit a fraction of the SOL. From what we can tell they saw our solar system, strapped mining equipment to a tin can, put themselves to sleep and drifted here. And get this. . . we 're detecting insane additional amounts of small combustibles and propellent devices. Hundreds of them. Thousands maybe. \" Qlorog's mouth was dry and it wasn't from the receptor input. \" Movement aids? Maybe? \" he offered. \" Right, that's what we thought too, like the fart machine drives, \" she answered, \" But it seems the stasis system for the lifeforms is specifically shielded to protect them from radiation and impact. They seem fragile. Qlaaf thinks it must be a religious thing. Qllalee says it is obviously fuel. I wrote my master's thesis on speculative alternative data storage technology. What if they 're filled with stories of an ancient primitive culture? Qllalee is probably right. Imagine their faces when we wake them up and show them blinks. Is n't this amazing? \" Qlorog tried to deeply sigh, but it was incredibly awkward at full hookup. \" I hope you don't mind, but we already requested a tow-in to Qqlchar-Base 1, \" Qlala interjected before Qlorog could even reply. \" This is too big a haul for us. You scoop up the birdies and I 'll meet you at base. We 're going to be famous ! \" Qlorog force quit his receptor without signing off, swallowed hard, and followed his orders."
