Sprawled on the bathroom floor, my body slumped in submission. The crackling of centuries finally catching up, grey hairs sprouting where clumps of brown now disintegrate. My muscles tremble as the skin around them loosen, wrinkles arching and sagging. I become barely bones and the skin that covers. Weakness overwhelms as I struggle to look at them.

It was never a dream, they did exist but their influence was beyond what I could have comprehended. I cursed the voices that echoed in my head, that pushed away everyone around me, that ensured I would end up in an asylum. The years spent arguing, rationalizing their presence and pretending everything was fine eventually became too much to bear. They drove off my greatest love, and I finally took my stand.

I told them to leave, their occupation was not welcomed, and they agreed.

I lie now on this bathroom floor as the spirits of my past evacuate, leaving behind the husk that shunned them. The life rushes from my body as I am left to stand on my own, and all I can utter is

" please. . . Please, don't go. "
