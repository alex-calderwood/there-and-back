When we discovered the secrets to longevity the religious fanatics were the first to denounce it. Every single religion cried out for the experimentation to stop, playing god they said we were. They were probably right. . . None of that bothered me now though, not in the slightest, that was hundreds of years ago now. I was imprisoned for crimes against humanity, crimes against the world, crimes for human testing. When they had assigned me three hundred years in prison they thought I would have expired long before the sentence was up. They had n't realised I had already dosed myself with the serum, 300 years was naught more than a blink for me now.

They realised after the first ten years of the sentence. After ten years in the harshest prison in Britain you 'd expect to have aged a bit quicker than your average human. A few grey hairs or some wrinkly lines on the face at the very least ; but I was free of all physical aging. My body clock had reverted to its prime, frozen in stasis, the lone immortal on Planet Earth, and one day I would be free.

I could see it now, those who had been tasked with keeping an eye on me down the years would be running around losing their heads. They 'd hoped I would have started to falter by now, that I would have tired, the serum would have started to lose its grip on my system. They were wrong and my science was infallible.

I had noticed a disturbing trend from within my cage. As the years went on I had expected the religious nature of humanity to deteriorate over the centuries, yet it seemed to only strengthen. My guards had become clerics, the prison had become emptier and emptier as the church stamped out this misbehaviour in their flock. When I was finally released from this crumbling building I would have a lot of work to do, I would have to release the world from the clutches of convent.
