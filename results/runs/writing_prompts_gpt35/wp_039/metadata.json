                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

I am not very happy with it, so any constructive criticism you can give would be appreciated it. I don't know if it's just that I 'm not good at writing dialogue, I picked a \" story \" without a good arc, or I just picked an annoying topic. And, it turns out it is too long, so I 'll have to post some in replies. Grr. Sorry you didn't get more responses, I think the topic is interesting. *\n\nPat was putting the finishing touches on her desk when Candice approached her.\n\n\" Patricia ! \" The older woman crooned, \" Welcome to the company. We ' re all very excited to have a bright young lady like you become part of the company. I ' m Candice, from sales \"\n\nPat turned to the woman behind her, opening her arms for a firm, business like hug. As you would expect from a saleswoman, Candice was impeccably dressed. Her Grecian shift flowed over her round bosom and hips. The sandals she had chosen for today completed the outfit to a T, and the folds expertly hid her pockets, leaving Candice looking free, mobile and capable. Pat felt like her own gauzy skirt and blouse were a little too utilitarian in comparison.\n\n\" You must be hungry, with all of the paperwork you ' ve had to do this morning. \" Candice purred, \" Why don ' t I take you to lunch? \"\n\n\" Oh, yes ! That would be great. \" Pat replied, \" I think David is still out at Staples getting some supplies Mary needed. He should be back any minute. \"\n\n\" Hmmm, Davie, yes. \" Candice ' s full, graceful features distorted slightly for a moment, \" I think the guys are going to take him out for a burger or something. I ' ve got a favorite spot in mind for us, and I don ' t think that he would feel like he fits in there. \"\n\nPat looked over at David ' s desk, uncertain. She wouldn ' t want him to feel left out, but he probably would be more comfortable being around other men, and Candice seemed impatient to leave.\n\nOn the car ride to the restaurant, Candice shared her life story. It was what you would expect of a top saleswoman. She had been in a well-respected dance group in High School, had been influential in her school ' s model World Commune, and had worked on three different teams that had successfully implemented community projects in her town. She had decided not to go to college, and had instead started selling immediately, beginning with small copy shops, moving to insurance, and then finally into custom manufacturing."
