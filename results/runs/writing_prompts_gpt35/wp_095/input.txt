4 days. 4 days since my wife died. 4 days the man has pushed the swing.

It scared me. Why would an old man sit outside, pushing an empty swing? Why would he start right after my wife died? Why does n't he stop? So many questions, and no answers. I figure I should tell someone, but I may be going insane. Ever since Irene died, I 've been only superficially secure.

All my life, I 've convinced myself I 've been far away from murder, but here I am right in the midst of it. My wife was murdered, no one knows who did it, and now someone just appeared. I doubt he's the killer -- the killer is probably on the run right now.

I decide that I should walk out of the house and talk to him for once. I open my door, cautiously walking out. I jog across the grass, sun flooding my vision, and decide to say something to the man.

" Hello. "

I hear a grunt. I am scared by it, but I pursue, for my Wife's sake if anything.

" Who are you? "

A more furious grunt. Afraid of angering him, I go back outside, and try to take a nap, failing in fear.

Finally I fall into a deep slumber, riddled with dreams.

I wake in the dark. I figure I napped until night, and get up to get a drink of water. Then I hear it -- the creak of the swing. Except much louder. I feel nauseous, but I 'm not sure why. I can't get up. Each time I try, I can't muster the strength. I 'm scared -- what is happening?

I sit there struggling, and then I hear a sound that echoes through my entire body, a sound of fear that makes me want to scream and cry and run away from this world. The sound? A grunt.

I make a whimper, and I move faster. Wait -- I 'm moving, back and forth. I anticipate inside what's happening, but I 'm not ready to accept it yet. I scream.

" Irene ! It's Steven ! "

Nothing except for a grunt, and the swing moves faster.

I fall asleep again.

I never wake.
