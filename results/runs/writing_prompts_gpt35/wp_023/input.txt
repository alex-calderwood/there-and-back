" Thomas Fredson you´re next ". . . " Thomas Fredson ", the man called again. Slowly Thomas dived out of his thoughts, now was his time, his big chance. The next few minutes would decide how long he still has to live. He stood up from his chair and followed the the clerk into the room of the high council. In front of him there there lay a man with a bagpipe in his hand and a bullet in his head. " We did not find his idea of getting shot while playing a bagpipe as funny as he did. Hopefully you have something better to offer. ", the leader of the high council said. Thomas hands started to shake as he tried to remember every detail of his plan. " So how would you like to die ", an other member of the council asked, with an evil smile on his face. So Thomas spoke : " I want to be shot with arrows, at a wedding, while the band plays " The Rains of Castamere " " " Not very creative to steal your idea from a tv-show " the leader said, " We will give you another year before you die " Thomas started crying while the clerk pulled him out of the room. " If he wouldn´t be so old, he surely we would have found a better plan, " he thought to himself, while leaving the room.
