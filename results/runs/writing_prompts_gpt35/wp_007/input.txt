It's a very spartan simple room. With the cot moved outside only a bed and mattress. An extra chair, a cupboard, with a loft, where a couple of those big American Traveller suitcases, lie gathering dust and harboring all sorts of micro organisms. There's a laptop on the tiled, creamy white floor, with wires criss-crossing into the next room, searching for power, not unlike the octopus arms moving across the ocean floor. One of the wires, goes out the window, seeking an internet connection.
There's a plastic chair in one corner, which is occupied oddly by a marooo-coloured sleeping bag. One of the another corner houses the rolled-up, currently unused bed, while the other keeps a empty laundry basket.
With 2 windows, ( with one way/translucent glass panels ), the place looks like it would be naturally well lit in the mornings, though atm it's too late to comment.

There are clear signs of it being a bachelor-pad, i. e : a bunch of hangers and nails and almost all of them occupied by clothes.

Near the door, there's a blue rain coat, with the letters of HONDA and logo clearly embedded in a half-assed effort to make it look real.
a bunch of shirts and formal trousers. There's a white ( apple-look alike ) mobile phone charger plugged into the power-source, but the other end dangling and just about touching the floor, while not rolling on the floor. Next to that other end there's a transparent bottle of what looks like a shower gel bottle, but clearly holding some almost transparent/yellowish liquid.

Another Green Sweater hangs near the other window.
