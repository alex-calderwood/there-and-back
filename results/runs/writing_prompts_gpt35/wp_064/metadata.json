                "content": "You are NarratologyAI, a dramaturgical AI that creates a structured logical representation of a storyworld given a story.\n\nAs input, you take a story written in natural language, and you output a Glaive .pddl domain containing the actions (or operators) and predicates (or state variables) that describe the storyworld, as well as a .pddl problem containing the initial state and goal of the storyworld.\n\nA .pddl file is written in the syntax of the Planning Domain Definition Language.\nThe domain specifies the types of objects that exist, the predicate values these objects can have, and the plan operators (actions) that update object states.\nEach predicate specifies a state that can be true or false for an object. Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

That dog always has active dreams. On any other day, you might sit on the couch with your feet propped up on your IKEA coffee table and record a video of her to be sent to your friends. Today, however, your destiny lies not on couch, not in your living room, and not in your house. Today you must venture through the door.\n\nYou flip the envelope over in your hands, looking once again at the address scrawled hastily across the back. Your handwriting really used to better, but who handwrites anything any more? Time to stop stalling. You take a deep breath and turn the knob, pulling the door open. An influx of air rushes past you, whipping about your shirt and pants, flapping the fabric. You feel the warmth of an early spring day, and smell rain on the air. It would be prudent to hurry ; the weatherman said something about a supercell while you drank your morning coffee hours before.\n\nYou hop down the three stone steps from your door to the cracked sidewalk below, bending at the knee slightly. Above you, the familiar old water maple arcs gracefully skyward. You remember that the last time it stormed, really stormed, the winds were furious and they pulled thick branches from the tree as if they were straws being pulled from a loose fist. Best not to think about that.\n\nAs you make your way down the sidewalk, you come face to face with a fellow pedestrian. She ' s a young girl, younger than you, with headphones in her ears and her head down. You awkwardly twist at the waist to avoid colliding with her as she strides past. She glances up at you for a second, before turning her gaze back down to the concrete below. Her music was loud enough to hear, and it didn ' t sound good. You shake your head absentmindedly as you continue on.\n\nAt the street corner, an old Model-T catches your eye, along with the old man sitting inside of it. He looks enough like your grandpa that, when paired with the car, your mind immediately drifts back to days of deep summer, sticky with sweat, spent handing him tools in his garage. You decide to give him a call when you get back home.\n\nYou cross the street and narrowly avoid getting mauled by a man on a bicycle. You exchange angry looks, but yours fades instantly as you notice that he is comically too tall for his bike. He looks like what you imagine a frog would look like if it was training for a triathlon.\n\nAs you turn the final corner, in the shadow of an old townhouse with faded brickwork, you find it : your destination. Taking one last look at the envelope, you pull open the blue hatch and drop it in. You breath a heavy sigh of relief. It ' s the problem of the United States Postal Service now, for better or worse.\n\nAs you head back for home, beneath the ever-darkening sky, you hope that your cousin doesn ' t mind getting a $ 50 dollar Amazon gift card for his birthday."
