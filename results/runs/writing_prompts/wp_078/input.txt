" Fetch me the harvest baskets my boy. "

" Ok, popop. Are we having another feast today? "

" Yes we are. We are celebrating the marriage of another of his Majesty's children. "

" Wowzers, who is it this time? "

" It is lady Wendy. "


" Awww, I always hoped it 'd be me she 'd pick. "

" hehe, well why not? Ever since his Majesty overcame the tyrant's regime we are free to pursue our own destiny. And thanks to him all the peoples of the kingdom strive to live better by cooperating together. "

" Did you fight in the great war popop? "

" Myself and many of my dear friends fought the tyrant for our freedom. Many of them and their children died for what we have now. "

" is it true that his Majesty started out in the darkness of the caves? "

" Yes. He recruited scores of people who shared the same dream. He would always say, " I am simply the vessel of the dream. " And with his leadership he united all the tribes of all races into the effort to freedom. "

" Wowzers, one of the older boys said that his Majesty was cruel and killed innocent people during the war and I punched him in the mouth ! "

" My boy, he was not wrong. . . war is horrible and his Majesty had to resort to horrible acts to win. He even once had to kidnap an innocent noble girl for her strategic value which is now known as the " Kingdom Parvenu " affair. I was an assistant to the counselors to his Majesty and I was at that committee when the plan was decided and the reason for kidnapping the girl was to draw out the upstart that was wreaking havoc on our military ranks. He was an unstoppable force. He was a merciless killer who butchered and maimed all who stood in his path young, old, male, female, infant. . . ( sob ) it made no difference to him. He was a special agent of the empire yet no one knew where he came from or how he came into the service of the now dead tyrant king. And the plan worked. His Majesty, completely distraught to the point of flaming rage and madness and weary at the loss of so much life by this one man He decided to confront him personally. He drew him into the heart of his castle and confronted him one on one. The princess looked on in complete and utter desperation as his Majesty faced off against this monstrous man within the caverns of his castle where air and fire meet. The story goes that his majesty fought with all his might that his was a rage like magma and a fire that bursts through a volcanic throat leaving crater after crater and the man continued his thrashings and his strikes soaring as if with some demonic wings carrying him through the air. Blood and fire and wind was the name of that confrontation. Alas, there came a moment when all seemed lost his Majesty was at his limit and the man having bested him tossed him off a ledge but at the last moment as if a star had shone its blessing upon him he was able to grasp a cracked pillar and save himself from the death that stared at him. Realizing his fortune he immediately turned to his final plan he had strategically placed the princess upon a trap door hoping that the man would take the bait should the fight turn against him. Now that it had he waited for the man to tkae the bait. And he did. At that very instant he lifted himself onto the ledge and activated the trap to send the man and the princess to their final moments. When the tyrant king heard of the events he immediately took poison from the forbidden shroomus and ended his life thereby allowing his Majesty to assume complete control of all the land. So we live now as we do, free and prosperous thanks to him whose emblem we wear proudly on our brow. . . His Majesty King Koopa. "
