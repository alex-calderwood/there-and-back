At Anglewood Manor, Mr. and Mrs. Anglewood were preparing for a grand hunt. Appropriate attire was essential, and Mr. Anglewood had meticulously laid out his hunting uniform and rifle. The rifle, however, was not yet cleaned, and the uniform needed to be adjusted to fit properly. Mrs. Anglewood, on the other hand, was busy attending to other matters. She wanted to ensure that the manor remained secure while they were gone. Carrying a letter with important instructions, she made her way to the kitchen.

In the living room, Mr. Anglewood carefully inspected his rifle, noticing that it needed to be cleaned before the hunt. Determined to have his weapon in top condition, he carefully cleaned and polished the rifle, ensuring that it would function smoothly during the hunt.

While Mr. Anglewood tended to his rifle, Mrs. Anglewood locked the door to the manor from the kitchen. With the letter still in her hand, she secured the premises, providing peace of mind while they were away. She had no intentions of letting any unwanted guests enter the manor while they were out hunting.

After cleaning his rifle, Mr. Anglewood turned his attention to his hunting uniform. The uniform had been tailored for him, but over time it had become a bit too snug. He diligently adjusted the uniform, ensuring that it would fit him perfectly during the hunt. Once the adjustments were complete, Mr. Anglewood donned his uniform, looking dapper and ready for their grand adventure.

With the rifle cleaned, the uniform adjusted and worn, and the door locked, the Anglewoods were finally prepared for their grand hunt. They were assured that they had taken all necessary precautions, guaranteeing a day filled with excitement and, ultimately, a triumphant return to their secure home at Anglewood Manor.
