Sweat dripped from Mr. Anglewood's brow as he slaved over the weathered metal. Stroke after stroke, his face blossomed into a reddish purple, the weight of his body sinking into his routine. The iron cast began to shimmer, it's rust removing with each pass of the cloth. His chair was weeping, the wood screaming to be released from its captor. Mrs. Anglewood watched nervously from the kitchen, idly holding the letter of approval.

" She's been dead for years, honey. Do you really think this will give you any peace? "

If Mr. Anglwood heard her, he showed no sign of it. Her breathing quivered. She knew her husband would not be persuaded from his path, so she began sobbing softly, fleeing to hide behind a door that locked. She threw the letter towards the refrigerator, and it landed soundlessly on the kitchen counter.

Unchanged, Mr. Anglewood remained focused on the process at hand. He had heard his wife's words, but did not care for her distress. Admittedly, performing maintenance in the living room was a tad dramatic, but he always liked to witness the effects of his actions, especially after the war. Unfortunately, Mr. Anglewood had grown too fat to fit in his uniform, and would have to continue on without it. He simply did not have the time to make proper adjustments without his wife's help. So he sat stroking the metal with his brush, waiting for the time to pass. The hunt would begin in less then an hour, and Mr. Anglewood needed his rifle to be clean.
