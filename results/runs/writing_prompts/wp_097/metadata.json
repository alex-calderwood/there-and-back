Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

We don't allow cameras in anymore ever since that one slaughterhouse was shut down for insanitary workplace. \" The man hissed.\n\nThe man got up. Assuming he was going to show me and my partner out the door I stood up and got close. A perfect distraction.\n\n\" Sir please. \" I said placing my hand on his shoulder. He yanked his arm away and looked as if I had given him a disease.\n\n\" You two leave my property now. \" He said swinging the door open.\n\nMy partner nodded at me and I knew we were good to go. Without making a sound we left his office and got into our car.\n\nHe jingled the warehouse keys and we both cheered victoriously. I drove the car toward the back of the warehouse. It was a massive structure, cheap looking, but we knew it was just to steer the eyes away from what really goes on in there.\n\nWe parked near a side door. He hopped out and tried the keys. He turned to me and gave me a thumbs up. Shutting the car off I followed right behind him into the dimly lit warehouse.\n\nThe smell was awful. Stale urine, rotten shit, rancid mold, all flooded my nose. In a massive room was probably a thousand pigs. All segregated into separate holding pins.\n\nMy partner looked at me as if we lose but I knew it was here. Human meet is served in our burgers and this is where they butcher it.\n\nMy eyes caught onto a large metal door riddled with locks. I motioned my partner to it and he quickly began to math the keys to the locks.\n\nTime was running out. The owner would know his keys were missing eventually.\n\nAs each click of lock being open sounded, I felt closer and closer to getting evidence of the cruel untold ingredients of fast food.\n\nMy parter strained to open the large door. We went down to what musty have been a basement. It was freezing so it had to have been a freezer also.\n\nThe smell of death replaced the rotten smell from above. My partner fell to his knees and began to throw up. He was in a doorway peering into something unbearable.\n\nI caught up and saw what I wish I had never seen.\n\nDangling from hooks were endless rows of human bodies.\n\nDisfigured, dismembered, some even in tact.\n\nThe frost in their bodies made them look ghostly. Then my heart fell.\n\nThe door we came in slammed closed. I rushed to bang on it. My partner on his knees in shock.\n\nI got to the door banging on it. Then I had chills down my back.\n\nClick. Click.\n\nWith each sound of the door locking, I knew my end was near."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
