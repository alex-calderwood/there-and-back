" I 'm doing a project for school. Anyway you can let me get a few shots of what goes on in there? " I asked the owner of the warehouse. He was a shifty looking fellow, obviously the kind of man they would hire to run their human chop shop.

" Nothing but animals in there son. We don't allow cameras in anymore ever since that one slaughterhouse was shut down for insanitary workplace. " The man hissed.

The man got up. Assuming he was going to show me and my partner out the door I stood up and got close. A perfect distraction.

" Sir please. " I said placing my hand on his shoulder. He yanked his arm away and looked as if I had given him a disease.

" You two leave my property now. " He said swinging the door open.

My partner nodded at me and I knew we were good to go. Without making a sound we left his office and got into our car.

He jingled the warehouse keys and we both cheered victoriously. I drove the car toward the back of the warehouse. It was a massive structure, cheap looking, but we knew it was just to steer the eyes away from what really goes on in there.

We parked near a side door. He hopped out and tried the keys. He turned to me and gave me a thumbs up. Shutting the car off I followed right behind him into the dimly lit warehouse.

The smell was awful. Stale urine, rotten shit, rancid mold, all flooded my nose. In a massive room was probably a thousand pigs. All segregated into separate holding pins.

My partner looked at me as if we lose but I knew it was here. Human meet is served in our burgers and this is where they butcher it.

My eyes caught onto a large metal door riddled with locks. I motioned my partner to it and he quickly began to math the keys to the locks.

Time was running out. The owner would know his keys were missing eventually.

As each click of lock being open sounded, I felt closer and closer to getting evidence of the cruel untold ingredients of fast food.

My parter strained to open the large door. We went down to what musty have been a basement. It was freezing so it had to have been a freezer also.

The smell of death replaced the rotten smell from above. My partner fell to his knees and began to throw up. He was in a doorway peering into something unbearable.

I caught up and saw what I wish I had never seen.

Dangling from hooks were endless rows of human bodies.

Disfigured, dismembered, some even in tact.

The frost in their bodies made them look ghostly. Then my heart fell.

The door we came in slammed closed. I rushed to bang on it. My partner on his knees in shock.

I got to the door banging on it. Then I had chills down my back.

Click. Click.

With each sound of the door locking, I knew my end was near.
