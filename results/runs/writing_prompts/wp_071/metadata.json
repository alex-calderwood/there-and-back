Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

Leave it to the Post to say someone has to work the tip line on statutory holidays and leave it to Marty and Lisa to pawn the job off on me.\n\nSo I 'm alone, on Christmas, in some rundown diner in Bethesda. It's the saddest place I 've ever been. Just a waitress with sciatica and two drunk truckers listening to Silent Night over sour coffee. Who asks to meet a reporter on Christmas Eve? All I know is she said she has the scoop of the decade. There was something in her voice that made me believe her.\n\nI try to watch out the window for anyone coming, but there's so much snow I can't even tell when a car turns into the lot. But then the door rattles and in she walks, the wind kicking up and yelping behind her. She walks right up to me. She smells like cinnamon, and something I forgot about when I stopped being a little boy anymore. When I learned how deep the lies go in this town.\n\nShe asks me if I 'm me. I nod and she slides into the booth beside me. She apologizes for the timing. Tonight's the only night she can know for sure she isn't being watched, she says. She's wearing a big trench coat and her hair is wrapped up in a handkerchief covered in candy canes. She pulls out a thick manila envelope and hands it over.\n\nMy god. This is a payload. This is Monica Lewinsky getting fucked by Edward Snowden in the Watergate hotel. This is a goddamn Pulitzer. Then I realize who she is. Who she must be.\n\n\" Mrs. C- \" I ask. She begs me not to say it aloud. I understand why.\n\nThat big red motherfucker. You 'd think the money from all those Coca Cola commercials would be enough. But no. He's sold all of it and the proof is all right here. He's sold every last file on every last American son and daughter going back to World War Two. Naughty. Nice. Did n't matter one bit. Every candy bar you swiped from a convenience store, every lie you told your mom, every porno you downloaded, the NSA knows all of it now. Nobody is safe. Nobody has a single secret. Sometimes a man can be a traitor even when working for his own government and that's what this is : treachery. There's not enough hoverboards or tickle-me-elmo's in the world to make up for a crime like this. Thomas Jefferson is rolling over in his grave.\n\nI tell her she did the right thing. I tell her the people deserve to know the truth, even if it's going to ruin their Christmas. I promise we 're running the story in the morning edition. She starts to cry. She tells me she's sorry she ever married him if this is what he was capable of. I cradle her face and stroke the tears from her cheek and she clasps my hand and smiles for the first time. Soon we 're kissing with our whole mouths and it feels like I 'm running down the stairs to unwrap presents under the tree.\n\nThe window shatters and the snow and wind fly in our faces. I can barely see, but there's two of them in green parkas and face masks, running towards us with AK-47s almost as tall as they are.\n\n\" Assassin elves ! \" she whispers. She tells me we have to run."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
