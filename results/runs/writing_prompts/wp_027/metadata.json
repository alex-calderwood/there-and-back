Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

Explosions rocked the earth in great heaving shudders. People began screaming and ran in all directions. Trees appeared as if they ' d been growing for years \u2014 no, decades ! Bodies fell from the sky and splashed the earth with a *thwuk*. There were no other sounds besides burning and the horror cries of the billions of people who had suddenly appeared \u2013naked.\n\nJennah had been two steps inside the building when, mid stride \u2013 a gap. Her clothes were gone and the world exploded in nightmare sounds. Looking down she found her business suit lying on the tiled floor, covered in dust. The air smelled of old furniture and the freshness of jungle. Not the normal smells of Prague !\n\nAmongst the awful screaming outside she heard a low moan of disgust and someone yelled, \" What the fuck? \" Ahead she found the bare-chested torso of a man extruding from the tiled floor. The bottom of him didn ' t seem to exist. He twisted and tried to move and couldn ' t. \" What ' s happening to me? \" he yelled and tried to pull himself free, but he was stuck. \" Help me ! \"\n\nJennah reached down to her clothes and lifted her skirt which promptly fell to pieces, disintegrating in her hands. Her shirt did the same. \" Help me ! \" the man yelled and she went to him in confusion and pulled him by the arm. But to no effect. He was inseparably connected to the floor.\n\nIn her nakedness she panicked. She ran out the door and found the street covered in dirt and grass and hundreds of stripped people lying as though they ' d fallen or tumbled from the sky. The cars which usually drove past at an easy thirty kay were absent. In places rusted wrecks mouldered under layers of decomposing forest. People were digging themselves out from under piles of dirt and grass.\n\nA scream. Bodies fell from the sky. Jennah pulled herself back under the shelter. At this time she pieced together a bizarre explanation, cursed, and told herself it wasn ' t true.\n\n\" Jennah ! \" a woman yelled and she turned to find Mila Huntakova naked and crying running towards her. Their bodies wacked together as the woman cried in her arms. \" What ' s happening? \" she wailed in Czech.\n\nJennah pushed her away and held her by the shoulders. \" I don ' t know \u2014 I don ' t know ! \" She took her by the hand as a crowd of confused men marched along the street chanting in, *Roman? * Their beards were long and they pushed everyone out of their way as they ran past.\n\nThe horrible truth descended upon her. She turned to Mila and slapped her. \" Did you feel that? \"\n\nMila yelled. \" Oooow ! \"\n\n\" Dammit, \" she said, \" that means we ' re not dreaming. \" Heavy breathing. The truth held her by the hair and made her acknowledge it. *Reality was a myth*. \" Mila, I think \u2014 no, this can ' t be. . . \"\n\n\" What? \"\n\n\" I think there's been a glitch in the Matrix. \""
