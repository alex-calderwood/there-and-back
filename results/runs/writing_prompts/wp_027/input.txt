It was in the second hour past sunrise as the morning sounds of birds chirped in the centre of Prague, when —*discontinuity*— the entire world groaned in one collective surge. Explosions rocked the earth in great heaving shudders. People began screaming and ran in all directions. Trees appeared as if they ' d been growing for years — no, decades ! Bodies fell from the sky and splashed the earth with a *thwuk*. There were no other sounds besides burning and the horror cries of the billions of people who had suddenly appeared –naked.

Jennah had been two steps inside the building when, mid stride – a gap. Her clothes were gone and the world exploded in nightmare sounds. Looking down she found her business suit lying on the tiled floor, covered in dust. The air smelled of old furniture and the freshness of jungle. Not the normal smells of Prague !

Amongst the awful screaming outside she heard a low moan of disgust and someone yelled, " What the fuck? " Ahead she found the bare-chested torso of a man extruding from the tiled floor. The bottom of him didn ' t seem to exist. He twisted and tried to move and couldn ' t. " What ' s happening to me? " he yelled and tried to pull himself free, but he was stuck. " Help me ! "

Jennah reached down to her clothes and lifted her skirt which promptly fell to pieces, disintegrating in her hands. Her shirt did the same. " Help me ! " the man yelled and she went to him in confusion and pulled him by the arm. But to no effect. He was inseparably connected to the floor.

In her nakedness she panicked. She ran out the door and found the street covered in dirt and grass and hundreds of stripped people lying as though they ' d fallen or tumbled from the sky. The cars which usually drove past at an easy thirty kay were absent. In places rusted wrecks mouldered under layers of decomposing forest. People were digging themselves out from under piles of dirt and grass.

A scream. Bodies fell from the sky. Jennah pulled herself back under the shelter. At this time she pieced together a bizarre explanation, cursed, and told herself it wasn ' t true.

" Jennah ! " a woman yelled and she turned to find Mila Huntakova naked and crying running towards her. Their bodies wacked together as the woman cried in her arms. " What ' s happening? " she wailed in Czech.

Jennah pushed her away and held her by the shoulders. " I don ' t know — I don ' t know ! " She took her by the hand as a crowd of confused men marched along the street chanting in, *Roman? * Their beards were long and they pushed everyone out of their way as they ran past.

The horrible truth descended upon her. She turned to Mila and slapped her. " Did you feel that? "

Mila yelled. " Oooow ! "

" Dammit, " she said, " that means we ' re not dreaming. " Heavy breathing. The truth held her by the hair and made her acknowledge it. *Reality was a myth*. " Mila, I think — no, this can ' t be. . . "

" What? "

" I think there's been a glitch in the Matrix. "
