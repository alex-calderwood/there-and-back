Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

It ' s what good dogs do, she told herself happily, and she was a good dog. As she padded after her Master, she noticed something was amiss. The Master smelled differently, he held himself differently, he breathed differently. She didn ' t understand what was wrong with Master, but when she heard him say \" L-let ' s go for walk\u2026 \" the catch in his voice stirred something ancient, something primal within her. Worry, and a desire to be as close as possible to her Master overcame her so strongly. She wanted to say, \" Are you okay? \" but could only manage a low pitiful whimper as she snuggled up to her Master who now sat shuddering on the stair with her leash in hand.\n\n\" He needs a W-A-L-K, \" a soft, loving, motherly voice came from above her. She side eye ' d the source\u2014a great big black yak of a dog. This was Boo, The One Before. Boo ' s features shifted and changed as she sat looking at the Master with her tail swishing back and forth softly on the hardwood floor. Grey and white whiskers blended in ebbs and flows across the night black of her beautiful coat, seeming to mark her as both an Old Bone and a Young Pup at the same time. All the while, The One Before ' s eyes shown like the Great of Eye of Night\u2014a constant across her ever changing features that somehow, made her more the same.\n\n\" Of course he does, Boo, \" Ori responded with no small amount of impatience. This was always The One Before ' s advice. Master is sleepy? He needs a walk. Master is mad? He needs a walk. Master is uncomfortable? He needs a walk. Master is Hungry? He needs a walk. Master is\u2026\nOri nuzzled her Master once again, and gave a louder whimper. Nothing. She gave a snort of frustration, stretched to bleed off the mounting energy, and stamped her feet. \" But he already knows he needs a W-A-L-K ! \" she looked pleadingly at the guardian, \" just look at his eyes, he ' s so far from the Herenow, I can ' t reach him ! \"\n\nThe One Before ' s tail stopped wagging, and she cocked her head to the side in thought. \" You must remember the ancient ways and oaths of our kin, young pup. Do as I do. \" Slowly, and softly The One Before padded over to the Master. As she did, Ori saw the Others step out of the ether and join Boo at The Spot at the Master ' s side. Each overlapping their forms at The Spot until Ori could not tell one guardian from another, and all that was left was the shifting form of Canis, with it ' s Eyes of the Night. Ori reflected that some of these guardians had never even met her Master, or even the Aeon of her Master, but they were all of her House. That was the nature of The Bond, the oath taken over fire and cracked marrow so many dogtimes ago, that so entwined the fates of the guardians and masters. Ori stood in still wonder as The One Before spoke, \" This is the Time of Passing, young pup, and you must be its Herald. Now come, take our Master for his first Walk, so that a new Aeon might begin. \"\nImmense pride swelled in Ori ' s chest as she walked the path of the guardians before her to The Spot at her Master ' s right hand. She placed her head on his knee and listened, and then after an eternity, she looked him in the eyes imploringly.\n\" Thanks for listening, \" her Master sniffed as he hooked up her leash, and she led him out the door.\nShe always listened.

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan is a list of character actions and story events that was generated from the domain and problem. It expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true:\n    (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate)\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a one-page natural language story in an engaging style using the provided domain, problem, and plan as a guide. All of the events in the plan must be present in your story in the correct order.\n\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with the provided story plan. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story, and the plan as the chronological ordering of events. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan can be generated from the domain and problem, and expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints. You won't have access to the plan, but should generate stories that adhere to a plan that could be generated from the constraints of the domain and problem.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with a hypothetical story plan produced by the domain and problem. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."
