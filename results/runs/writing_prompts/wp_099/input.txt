It was an exuberant day when Flores spotted the gull soaring overhead. He quickly jumped away from his post and ran to the bow of the ship.

" Captain ! Captain Santos ! We ' re approaching land, I saw a bird in flight near the stern ! " Flores explained with heavy breathing.

The Captain, that being Luis Santos, a rugged man with a heart of gold, turned toward Flores along with a group of crew members standing at the wheel. Smiles broke on the men ' s faces, the prospect of their voyage to the New World finally ending, a new chapter beginning.

" And down there ! " A crewman said startled. " Vegetation, down in the water. " Surely enough there was leafy branch sliding on the waves.

Captain Santos informed the crew that land was ahead, and they prepared for landing.

Upon approaching the land ' s shore, some men started to pray. " Finally land ! " Some said. " Thank the Old Ones we made it ! " Talk of the natives broke out. Discussion of who they worshiped, and how receptive to the Spanish ' s gods would they be.

" Dagon blessed these waters we traveled. " Captain Santos told his crew. " He will be with us on this mission of conversion. He will aid in the natives finding the righteous path of the Elder Gods. "

Land was very close now. The ship ' s crew prepared flags of their faith to stick the shore with. Symbols of Cthulhu and Dagon, and images of R ' lyeh.

" They will come to their senses. They will accept the Old Ones. Or perish. " Captain Santos announced as the crew prepared to land.

" Cthulhu fhtagn ! " The conquistadors called, readying for storming the shore.
