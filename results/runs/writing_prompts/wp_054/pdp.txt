In a small town in the Irish countryside, a secret rebellion brewed against the oppressive government. The protagonist, a proud and determined Irishman, was at the heart of the resistance, along with a group of close-knit auxiliaries. They operated from the shadows, always wary of the informants who aimed to expose them.

Two notorious informants, known only as Informant1 and Informant2, had made their way into the protagonist's inner circle by false means and were now dangerously close to sabotaging the rebellion. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious visitor had arrived in town, sharing the same goal as the rebellion: to take down the snitches and secure the revolution.

It was a peculiar day, as the protagonist and the auxiliaries found themselves at the church, praying for their cause. Unsurprisingly, the informant duo had also joined them there. Meanwhile, the visitor quietly made their way to the protagonist's home, where a hidden weapon - a Webley revolver - awaited them. They retrieved the weapon, knowing that the time had come to put an end to the treacherous informants.

As the church bells tolled, the visitor approached the house of worship, gun in hand, and made their way inside. Hiding in a pew, they identified their targets and took a deep breath to steady their aim. The informant pair had been too comfortable among their supposed comrades, unaware of the danger they were in.

The church suddenly went eerily silent as the mysterious visitor fired two shots in rapid succession. The bullets hit Informant1 and Informant2, ending their lives and their threat to the rebellion. With their mission complete, the visitor left the church as the protagonist and auxiliaries looked on, grateful for the help.

Their common enemies had been vanquished, and the protagonist's faith in the cause was reaffirmed. The Irish rebellion would live on, now stronger and more determined than ever before.
