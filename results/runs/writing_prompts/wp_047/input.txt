Just six months. That's all we really needed when our backs were against the wall, all we really needed for peace was our own imminent destruction. Kind of poetic, right? After millennia of war, nation against nation, creed against creed, mankind stood together at the last, all efforts failed, all possibilities tried together, all barriers broken down in those months of searching for a way to save us all.

And then, it didn't come. Mankind stood together and watched the sky. . . and nothing happened. When TV stations around the world spread the news that we were safe, that it was over, that it had missed us by a whisper, we stood, some stunned, some weeping, some screaming with joy.

But in that six months, oh the things we learned ! The things we discovered together, sharing information as fast as minds could think it up, the ideas we discarded one after another all had value, they all gave us new directions to explore. In the aftermath of world peace, no one wanted to break the spell, to be cut off from the technology we 'd forged together, and so no one did. No one dared. No one wanted to be left behind.

The end of the world that wasn't was the start of the newest age of technology, and the greatest time of peace.

Together, we look to the stars.
