I knew it was going to happen. I tried to tell them. Told them to prepare. Just like Noah and that boat, everyone ignored me or made fun of me. I guess I did appear ridiculous before it happened.

Crazy little old me building my tiny fifteen foot by twenty foot, one room house. Building a spring house and running water straight down off the mountain from the creek. Putting up solar panels and powering everything with the warmth of the sun. Using hand tools instead of power tools. Stocking up on things most people only buy when necessary. Like batteries, candles, toilet paper. Planting a garden four times bigger than what I need. Staying up all night canning. Teaching myself how to do the things my ancestors had to do, in order to survive.

Yeah, they called me crazy until all the computers died. I remember seeing grown men cry while they stood at gas pumps that wouldn't pump anymore. The frustration of the local grocery store owner was apparent when he picked up a register and threw it out the window. It was kind of funny watching the same man struggle to count back change and stop people from walking out the broken window with stolen goods. I was shocked to find how many people had n't realized that their electricity relied on those computers. Women handled it better than men until they learned the companies that made their clothes, shoes and makeup were doomed without computers. Since it happened I have seen the worst and the best in people.

Children were the first to recover. Maybe from boredom, but it wasn't long before I noticed children running races, playing ball, jumping rope, reading real books and they were the first to come to me and ask to learn. Soon groups of adults came, as well. Some were hoping for handouts. A few were looking to cause trouble or steal. They all found out quick enough that there was only one thing I was willing to share. Only one thing they would leave with and that thing was knowledge. I have taught them to survive.

Many people consider this the end of the or hell on earth. Me? I actually like it better this way. Now I sit out on my little front porch and watch as the people scurry around doing the things I have taught them. Yes, sooner or later they will figure out what I did. How I stopped all the computers. They will stumble across the answers. Then they will probably kill me, but for now I am their Queen and they can't survive without me.
