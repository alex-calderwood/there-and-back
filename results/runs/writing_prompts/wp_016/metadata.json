They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

I guess I did appear ridiculous before it happened.\n\nCrazy little old me building my tiny fifteen foot by twenty foot, one room house. Building a spring house and running water straight down off the mountain from the creek. Putting up solar panels and powering everything with the warmth of the sun. Using hand tools instead of power tools. Stocking up on things most people only buy when necessary. Like batteries, candles, toilet paper. Planting a garden four times bigger than what I need. Staying up all night canning. Teaching myself how to do the things my ancestors had to do, in order to survive.\n\nYeah, they called me crazy until all the computers died. I remember seeing grown men cry while they stood at gas pumps that wouldn't pump anymore. The frustration of the local grocery store owner was apparent when he picked up a register and threw it out the window. It was kind of funny watching the same man struggle to count back change and stop people from walking out the broken window with stolen goods. I was shocked to find how many people had n't realized that their electricity relied on those computers. Women handled it better than men until they learned the companies that made their clothes, shoes and makeup were doomed without computers. Since it happened I have seen the worst and the best in people.\n\nChildren were the first to recover. Maybe from boredom, but it wasn't long before I noticed children running races, playing ball, jumping rope, reading real books and they were the first to come to me and ask to learn. Soon groups of adults came, as well. Some were hoping for handouts. A few were looking to cause trouble or steal. They all found out quick enough that there was only one thing I was willing to share. Only one thing they would leave with and that thing was knowledge. I have taught them to survive.\n\nMany people consider this the end of the or hell on earth. Me? I actually like it better this way. Now I sit out on my little front porch and watch as the people scurry around doing the things I have taught them. Yes, sooner or later they will figure out what I did. How I stopped all the computers. They will stumble across the answers. Then they will probably kill me, but for now I am their Queen and they can't survive without me."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
