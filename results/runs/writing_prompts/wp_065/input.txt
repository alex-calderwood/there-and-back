Disease sits talking to Nuclear and says " I think I am gon na win this round. You know my only regret is that it takes so damn long for the world to rebuild and for the new Gods to grow when people create them to fulfill their need for explanation. " Nuclear responds " Yeah it kinda sucks that we only live as long as we have followers and we die when we lose our last one but there is no freakin ' way your winning this game. My remaining humans are safe in a bunker deep under ground where you cant get to them. They are about to launch the next wave of bombs and end all life topside. no more sicko for you. Game over, I win. "
Deep in the bunker Bill calls out to Colonel Thomas. " Ready for launch sir " Colonel Thomas sighs deeply and says " May God is he exists have mercy on our souls ". . . . " Launch. . . " -cough. Disease smiles.
