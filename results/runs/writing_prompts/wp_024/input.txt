Karl stood in front of me. He was a pretty big guy and, judging by the smirk on his face, was as aware as I that I wasn't going to win any fight against him.

* " Mornin ' " *. There was a drawl there, intentionally placed to provoke me.

* " Morning, Karl. What do you want? " *

I knew what he wanted, of course. I 'd crossed him ; that had been a mistake. Not my first. Thankfully, given my intentionally ridiculous Event choice all those years ago, it wouldn't be my last. No matter how this played out. And I had a sneaking suspicion I knew how this was going to play out.

* " So, you took something. Was n't yours. And you took it from me. Man, that was stupid. A stupid, stupid shame. I liked you, kid. Had promise. " *

I grinned ; a quick, fleeting twitch of the facial muscles that didn't reach any other part of my body. I was cold, standing here, and there was a rising panic within me I couldn't quite place. I 'd just come back. Why was I so worried? There was something about him, though. Something about his stance. And I could hear something behind me. A metallic sound, like someone moving a large mass of steel, and scraping it against the floor.

Karl grinned back ; a much more sincere affair then mine : * " Technology is amazin ', ai n't it? The things we can learn to do. " *

I heard the scraping sound getting closer. Definitely something heavy. I could just about hear the ragged breathing of whoever was dragging it. There was something else, too. A sort of shuffling sound, muffled. . .

* " I mean, we cure all kinds of disease. Every day. Amazin ' stuff. Smart people all 'round the world, no? " *

This made no sense to me. I tensed up, expecting a fight. Assuming he was throwing me off my guard, off my game. Karl didn't so much as bat an eyelid. Just stood there. Watching me, sizing me up. He just kept speaking, in that maddeningly relaxed fashion. As though he was chatting about the weather, or the sport scores. . .

* " It was only a matter of time, really. Someone was goin ' to figure it out. Figure out how it worked, how to dig deep enough. How to find out. . . " *. Karl stretched, suddenly, rotating his neck around his shoulders, loosening up. The screech of metal on concrete came to an abrupt stop, right behind me, and a high-pitched squeal sounded.

I turned. Slowly. Something in me snapped, and terror flooded in, and I knew I had to see. Two men - guys I didn't know - were manoeuvring a small kangaroo out of a cage. I took this in quickly, noting the small Santa hat that was clutched by one of the men, and the curiously specific pattern they had shorn out of its fur.

* " Once we knew, y'see, it was just a matter of preparation. Thing is, though. . . " *

I spun. Too slowly. I felt the blade sink into my abdomen. One scream, choked off by a gloved hand, and I didn't feel much of anything. As my vision blurred, I saw Karl peering down at me, a strange look on his face.

* " Thing is, I feel it kinda makes a mockery of the whole thin ', y'know? Does n't feel so spiritual anymore. " *

As the cold air hissed over my lip, forcing its way into my lungs for what I knew was the last time, I saw Karl motion to the men. My last sight was of that Kangaroo. Dressed in a santa hat. Staring quizzically down at me. Was a stupid fucking choice, I thought. Had to make everything a joke. Had to have the last laugh. . .

My final sight was of the high contrast between the Kangaroo's shorn skin and the dark, luxurious fur. I smiled despite myself. I was such a jackass.

" LOL ", it read, gleaming against the beast's dark coat, and the burgeoning darkness that swept me up. Then all was silent.
