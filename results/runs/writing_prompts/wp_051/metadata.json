They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

The Reconquista by the bastard nations of Portugal, Castile and Aragon has driven us from our native home lands. I was a boy when I saw our capital burn, and I still recall the tears my father wept as Granada burned to the ground.\n\nBut, my anger is with the bastard nations, not with their god. Allah is great, and has room in His kingdom for all men of the book. We fled south, my father taking our broken nation to the lands given to us by Morocco. My father knew we would have to rebuild again. He turned those harsh lands into the fertile grounds for the New Granadian empire.\n\nI was only 15 when I took my fathers throne for him. I spent the rest of my life making Granada great again. I built the great ships we have used to settle the Americas. I alone moved the capital to the Caribbean seas, and built New Granada with the finest architects money could buy.\n\nI led our navies in battle against the bastard nations, and few cheered louder than I when we sunk the Portuguese navy. We are the gatekeepers for the Americas. I have built vast plantations for sugar, farm estates for grains, and great trading houses to sell our many slaves and war prisoners.\n\nI am an old man now, and I have left many sons to rule this kingdom well. My time to rejoin Allah is coming near, and I do not fear that day. We have taken these lands, and shaped them. Molded them for Allah, and for the glory of the Sunni faith. I have nothing to fear, and look forward to seeing my father again in Paradise.\n\n- Akarim the Great, 1st Caliph of the New Granada Empire."
