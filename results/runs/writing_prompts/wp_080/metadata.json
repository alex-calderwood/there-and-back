Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

She swung her pickaxe at the rock wall, dislodging a large chunk of ore. Tossing the pick aside, she wrapped her four arms around the chunk and tossed it in a minecart. A loose strand of hair fell across her sweaty forehead. She paused and examined the two arms attached to her rib cage. \" Besides, once my sentence is done, they will remove the extra arms. \"\n\n\" Does it. . . does it hurt? \"\n\nShe shook her head. \" Not really, although you 'll be sore for the first week\u2014but you 'll probably be sore anyway. You ever worked in a mine before? \"\n\n\" No. I worked in the palace my whole life. \" I tried to swing my pick at the wall but it bounced off the rock with a clang. The reverberation hurt my hands and I flinched.\n\n\" You have to find the loose spots, here\u2014 \" Molly scraped at the wall, revealing a long crack in the rock. \" Try it there. \"\n\nI swung again. My pick sank easily into the cracks. I pulled on the shaft and dislodged a small cascade of dust and stones.\n\n\" There you go ! \" Molly smiled. \" What did you do, before? \"\n\n\" I. . . \" I opened my mouth but no answer came. What do I tell this woman? That I was a handmaiden to the princess herself? That I had been her best friend? Maybe hHer only friend? That I had been imprisoned for daring to resist her brother's advances?\n\n\" It's ok, sweetie\u2014you don't have to talk about it. We 're all the same down here anyway. \"\n\n\" No, it's alright. I. . . stole some food in the market. \" The lie felt awkward in my mouth. Truth and fiction had never been an issue, before. My life had been laundry and bathing and tea times, sewing and cleaning.\n\nMolly frowned. \" Wow, they must be getting stricter. I 've never met a simple thief in the mines before. \"\n\n\" The famine is getting worse, \" I offered. In truth, I had never been outside the palace walls. I had no idea how people lived in the city, but I had heard two of the guards discussing the food shortage.\n\n'Well, once you 've got your arms, you 'll get as much food as you need to work. \" She wiped her face with one hand. \" In fact, I could use a snack. Can you run up to the waystation and get us some apples? \"\n\nI nodded and laid my pickaxe against the wall. I hurried up the narrow tunnel. Just as I approached the torchlights of the waystation, a voice hissed at me. I turned. A small goblin beckoned to me from a small hole in the wall.\n\n\" You ! You 're from the palace. \"\n\n\" Y-yes? \"\n\n\" Do n't believe the horse woman. \" The goblin cupped one ear and listened. Hearing nothing, he continued. \" She works for them, girl. They send her the new ones, before. . . the change. \"\n\nI shuddered. \" I don't want more arms. I shouldn't even be down here. \"\n\nThe goblin smiled maliciously. \" There are worse things than arms, girl. Much worse. \"\n\nThe goblin and I turned at the sound of clopping horsefeet. \" She's coming, \" he hissed. \" Remember\u2014don't trust her. \"\n\nI turned to go but the goblin grabbed my arm and pulled me close. \" You aren't alone down here, handmaiden. Not everyone in these mines is a pawn of the prince. \"\n\nI tried to pull away, my fingers prying at the goblin's hand, but his fingers dug into my flesh. The clopping grew nearer. \" Please, you 're hurting me. \"\n\n\" Do not lose hope, girl, no matter what they do to you. \" He glanced down the tunnel. \" There's a war coming. A revolution. \"\n\nHe released my hand and faded into the shadows as Molly turned the corner. I waved to her and smiled.\n\n\" We need you, girl. Stay alive. \"\n\nI look back at the hole but the goblin is gone.\n\n*****\nIf there's interest, I might continue the story of the princess ' handmaiden who must escape a prison mine to save her best friend and, ultimately, the realm.

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
