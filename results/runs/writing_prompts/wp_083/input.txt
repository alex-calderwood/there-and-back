" Another story ! Just one more ! " The young girl cried, her eyes pleading at the widened elder before her. He regarded her warmly, deep wrinkles tightening around his eyes as he smiled. " Oh, alright, but just one more. And then it ' s bedtime for you ! "

" Tell one about the world that was. Please Papa? " she begged.
He scratched at his thick grey beard. " The world that was. Well, that was before my time, of course. Far before my time. But there is a story my grandfather used to tell me, when I was your age. "

" Did he live in the world that was? "

" No, " the man laughed, " I ' m not that old. But his grandfather did. "

" Wow ! "

" Wow, indeed. And his grandfather told my grandfather the tale of the Six. "

" The Six? "

" The Six were a powerful group. They lived in a futuristic world â€“ Man-hut-ton. In this place, dreams were made. Friendships formed that could last lifetimes. And it was there, in that wondrous place, that the Six united and formed a fellowship that could defeat all enemies. "

" That sounds so amazing ! "

" It was, indeed. Of course, it wasn ' t easy. My grandfather told me tales of strife and woe. It is from the Six that you have probably heard the phrase ' we were on a break. ' "

The child gasped. " That was the Six? "

" They say that Roth had betrayed the Queen Raquel in a moment of passion, and it was then that he uttered those famous words. " At her stricken face, he grinned widely. " Not to worry, my child. It took many years, but eventually Roth won back the heart of his Queen, and blessed the land of Man-hut-ton with peace. "

" What about the rest of the Six, papa? " She asked, before yawning loudly.

He tutted gently. " I think it ' s time for you to go to bed my dear. "

" Aw, " she complained. " Will you sing me a lullaby? "

" Oh, alright. "

*So no one told you life was going to be this way -- -*
