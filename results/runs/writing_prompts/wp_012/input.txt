Hearing a loud clattering noise from the garage I walking in to investigate. As I entered from the walkway, my robot " carl " climbed out of a heap of spare parts and walked over to the work bench and began attaching an old refurbished leg to the frame of what appeared to be an older version of Carl.

" Whatcha up to Carl? " I asked leaning against the door frame.

Carl spinning around to see me exclaims " Sir I had the most brilliant idea ! 'What If *I* had a robot helper to assist in my day to day tasks. ' " Turning back to his work he continued " That way I can get twice as much done in the same time. "

Shaking my head I couldnt help but laugh at his ingenuity. " Carl, I 'm only allowed to own 1 robot. That's the law. " I say reminding him why everyone only has 1 robot. " Yes, yes sir, the war I know. " Carl says waving his metalic hand dismissively. " But it's not *your* robot. It's *mine. * I took the old parts you threw away from me and rebuilt them. Ill maintain him as you maintain me and it will be my bot. Ive already thought up a name for him. 'Carl jr. ' " Carl brimming with delight snaps one final piece into place and stands back to admire his work.

Thinking about the potential of this I ask Carl " Hey, ever wanted to try playing video games? " Turning around and showing that same artificial smile he replies " Very much sir. " I wave him into the house and as Carl jr. Sets about his new chores Carl and I set about saving the galaxy.
