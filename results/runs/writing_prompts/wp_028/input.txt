" A beer for me and the young man here " the barman accepts the order and goes to get it.

" Oh thank you, but no thank you, I don't drink " Shelby told the old man.

" Then why you be at a pub? " The old man asked.

Shelby tried to look for an answer, but couldn't seem to find one, so he made one up " I 'm feeling a little unwell, so I figure going out may help ".

The old man gave Shelby a odd look. " How long have you been unwell? "

" About a week ago, why? "

" Makes sense "

By this point the old man looked a little younger than he did before, for some reason this didn't distress Shelby, it should of. " I 'm sorry I didn't catch your name ".

" Frost, nice to meet you Shelby " Frost said as he held out his hand for a handshake.

Shelby shook Frost's hand, though frost's hand felt. . . off, he didn't know why, come to think of it something frost said put Shelby off, was it his name? , no why would that distress Shelby? , something he said afterwards. . . . . . SHELBY 'S NAME !.

Shelby violently took his hand away from frost, putting a smile on frost's young vibrant face. . . . wait.

" Have you figured it out yet? " asked frost

" Who the hell are you ! "

" Guess not. . . . "

Shelby ran out of the pub, not disturbing anyone in the pub. Shelby ran out to see a green creature, made up of ones and zeroes, forming a feline like monster with large talons.

" Rogue " it bellowed.

Shelby couldn't do anything but stare, he was frozen, unable to react. The creature leaped for Shelby, as Frost pushed Shelby out the way and fire a ball of misty white energy into the creatures face.

Frost stood over Shelby " You 're in deep shit friend, and it looks like you owe me one " Frost's face turned completely white and formed a weird helmet made of ice.
