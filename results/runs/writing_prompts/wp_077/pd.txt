Once upon a time, in an ordinary world, there lived a poem. This poem, titled "Poem1," was alive with vibrant colors and emotions, ready to be discovered by anyone who dared to venture into its depths.

One day, a curious reader, known as "Reader1," stumbled upon Poem1. The profound beauty and unparalleled wisdom it held captivated Reader1's heart. As per the cosmic law of poems, Reader1 intended to read Poem1 and echo its essence within their soul.

Reader1 took their time, carefully absorbing each word and line as they read Poem1. The poem's spirit enveloped Reader1, creating a powerful resonance between the two. As Reader1 continued reading, the poem's life force began to ebb away, as was the natural course of life for a poem.

Upon finishing Poem1, Reader1 felt an urge to echo the poem's message, and so they did. The echoes reverberated through Reader1's very being, leaving a lasting imprint on their soul. The bond between Reader1 and Poem1 grew stronger as the echo spread far and wide.

As the echoes constantly resounded, the vibrant life force that once sustained Poem1 gradually diminished. It was the fate of every poem to eventually die, and Poem1 was no exception. This natural cycle allowed the poem to be carried on by its reader, living on in memory and spirit.

In the end, Reader1 achieved what they intended: they had read Poem1, echoed its essence, and witnessed its eventual passing. The life of Poem1 was now complete, its words and meaning carried forth by Reader1, as the poem's existence transformed from a temporal state into an eternal memory.
