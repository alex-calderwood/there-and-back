" You really want to sleep, right? "

I nod. " If you had woken me, you would be dead now. "

" Right, those shmucks from like an hour ago woke you. Right? It's been ages since you got to sleep for more than a year or two. How about me and my gang try to keep them away so you can get some real sleep? "

_That. . . would be nice. _ By my silence, he correctly inferred that he should continue.

" How about we install a nice sound-proof door on the tunnel in here. We stop them before they make it to your door. You don't even notice. "

_Oh that would be amazing. Take a deep breath, though. _ " What do you get? "

" We rob them. Not complicated. What do you say? "

It worked nicely for six years. The best I ever had.

But when I woke. . . I heard through my feet the grinding of great machines. I flipped the wall open with my nose and got a ballista bolt in the neck for my trouble. That stung ! Looking down, I saw over a thousand heavily armed warriors filling the cave, punctuated by various siege engines.

A few fire breaths later, the passage was nearly clear.

Wondering what had happened, I spied a survivor and approached. His eyes practically popped with terror, or perhaps it was the burns.

" What are you doing here? "

After a bit of stammering, he explained, and I shortly pieced it together : The gang's business model had involved spreading stories of how you _could_ steal from my hoard, to lure in more thieves, whom they would rob. The locals had eventually caught on, but they had attracted a bit more attention than they had counted on, from further off.

I was tempted to be angry at the gang, but reflected - they had given me six years, and my hoard was now bigger than it would have been after a hundred.

All in all, it had been a good deal.
