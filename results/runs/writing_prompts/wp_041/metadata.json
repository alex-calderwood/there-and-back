Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

His life now, was like living out a day in the movie \" Ground hog Day \", because as of 137 days ago, Mark was basically, Kidnapped, by Government forces because Mark had a talent that was desperately needed, if Mankind was to continue existing. But on this day, as he sat down to eat his breakfast he heard noises coming from Lab B, this was a first and only meant one thing ; he has been successful and the war against the dead was about to start swaying in favor of the living.\nNormally, Mark starts his day in Lab A where he tweaks and 3D-prints his prototypes. He then takes those prototypes ( consisting of a very tiny but super explosive compound, about 4 inches of fiber optics, a couple small electronic components all encased in a synthetic Bio compound/skin ) and places them in lab rats. Those rats then go into Lab B ; prior to today, they were always dead by the next morning. Mark's initial joy came from knowing that he would not be cleaning up Rat parts today, but was quickly replaced with the overwhelming joy that he can now start putting these devices in humans and win this war against the dead Army that grows faster every day.\nMark first confirms that the rats are behaving normally and that the electronics have not malfunctioned ; all checks out. Now its time to call his \" captors \" who he now sees as his fellow humans, after learning the dire need of his services. After calling COL Telt, he quickly went to Lab A to start 3D-Printing three more prototypes, this time with a slightly larger piece of explosives and about 2 feet of fiber optics. The super tiny CPU electronics remained the same.\nBy the time the COL arrived about 10 minutes later, all three larger prototypes were complete and that was only using one of the hundreds of 3d-Printers on hand.\n\nCOL : \" You sounded excited Mark, what you got for me? \"\n\nMark : \" It's done Sir, we can start the human trial and I volunteer \"\n\nMark was so confident and keen on being the first to get the implant because he had seen the dead reanimate and he feared that more than death itself. He did not want to return to the living and he did not want to be responsible for taking other peoples lives and therefore helping the army of the dead.\n\nCOL : \" Well Mark, lucky for you we are not bound by previous Governmental regulations ; I was tasked to figure out a way to defeat the dead Army and by-God we are about to start seeing things in our favor ! \"\n\nMark : \" Sir, after Dr. Linkens gets here, ill have her install the implant and if I wake up tomorrow morning Ill start my day by getting all printers on full production. \" The COL replies with a resounding, \" sounds like a plan \"\n\nThat night Mark had gone to bed with his new implant, and thoughts of how the war up to this point was basically a war of numbers. . . numbers that were quickly leading to the eventual extinction of humans. Mark wasn't even scared that he now was going to live out his life with a shape-charge explosive designed to completely obliterate his brain while leaving his skull intact. Once his heartbeat was not detected for a total of 2 minutes, the charge would detonate and immediately prevent any reanimations from occurring.\nThe time was set so low because reanimation times differed, depending on proximity of a dead army overlord ; 2 minutes seemed like a fair balance.\n\nThe next morning Mark awoke and was excited to get to work because tomorrow, he would start the monumental task of placing implants into every person left in the world. Luckily, every last group of people alive were in Eastern Russia, where the Humans united to make their last stand. . . Humans will not go extinct this go around."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
