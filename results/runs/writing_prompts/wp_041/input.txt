Mark woke up this morning as he done over a hundred times before. His life now, was like living out a day in the movie " Ground hog Day ", because as of 137 days ago, Mark was basically, Kidnapped, by Government forces because Mark had a talent that was desperately needed, if Mankind was to continue existing. But on this day, as he sat down to eat his breakfast he heard noises coming from Lab B, this was a first and only meant one thing ; he has been successful and the war against the dead was about to start swaying in favor of the living.
Normally, Mark starts his day in Lab A where he tweaks and 3D-prints his prototypes. He then takes those prototypes ( consisting of a very tiny but super explosive compound, about 4 inches of fiber optics, a couple small electronic components all encased in a synthetic Bio compound/skin ) and places them in lab rats. Those rats then go into Lab B ; prior to today, they were always dead by the next morning. Mark's initial joy came from knowing that he would not be cleaning up Rat parts today, but was quickly replaced with the overwhelming joy that he can now start putting these devices in humans and win this war against the dead Army that grows faster every day.
Mark first confirms that the rats are behaving normally and that the electronics have not malfunctioned ; all checks out. Now its time to call his " captors " who he now sees as his fellow humans, after learning the dire need of his services. After calling COL Telt, he quickly went to Lab A to start 3D-Printing three more prototypes, this time with a slightly larger piece of explosives and about 2 feet of fiber optics. The super tiny CPU electronics remained the same.
By the time the COL arrived about 10 minutes later, all three larger prototypes were complete and that was only using one of the hundreds of 3d-Printers on hand.

COL : " You sounded excited Mark, what you got for me? "

Mark : " It's done Sir, we can start the human trial and I volunteer "

Mark was so confident and keen on being the first to get the implant because he had seen the dead reanimate and he feared that more than death itself. He did not want to return to the living and he did not want to be responsible for taking other peoples lives and therefore helping the army of the dead.

COL : " Well Mark, lucky for you we are not bound by previous Governmental regulations ; I was tasked to figure out a way to defeat the dead Army and by-God we are about to start seeing things in our favor ! "

Mark : " Sir, after Dr. Linkens gets here, ill have her install the implant and if I wake up tomorrow morning Ill start my day by getting all printers on full production. " The COL replies with a resounding, " sounds like a plan "

That night Mark had gone to bed with his new implant, and thoughts of how the war up to this point was basically a war of numbers. . . numbers that were quickly leading to the eventual extinction of humans. Mark wasn't even scared that he now was going to live out his life with a shape-charge explosive designed to completely obliterate his brain while leaving his skull intact. Once his heartbeat was not detected for a total of 2 minutes, the charge would detonate and immediately prevent any reanimations from occurring.
The time was set so low because reanimation times differed, depending on proximity of a dead army overlord ; 2 minutes seemed like a fair balance.

The next morning Mark awoke and was excited to get to work because tomorrow, he would start the monumental task of placing implants into every person left in the world. Luckily, every last group of people alive were in Eastern Russia, where the Humans united to make their last stand. . . Humans will not go extinct this go around.
