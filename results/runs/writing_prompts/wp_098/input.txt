They told me I was devoid of feeling. I don ' t try or care to remember who ' they ' were and even if I did I don ' t think I ' d be sane afterwards. I ' m very close to not being sane currently, as a matter of fact, as I watch the last soul on the planet fade away. The cold, tear-ridden, gaze of the woman representing over a trillion years of evolution, life, emotion and culture now vanishing from existence, just as a fly with a swift swat.

I don ' t really know what to feel. As I said ' they ' just said I couldn ' t, so that was that. I just simply didn ' t. For the trillions of years those lovably flawed beings lived on that little blue ball of theirs, I had grown to call my home, I swiftly and skilfully lead every life on that planet to eternal darkness, without thinking about it further. And now, the feeling of unprecedented sadness I could perceive through the emotions of people witnessing loved ones go, as I took them for my own, enfolds me an uncountable times over. The thought of the ultimate end had never struck me before. I knew the end was coming, sure, but to actually have it happen? It seemed impossible at the time. I suppose we are the same in a lot of ways, them and I. They didn ' t expect it either while they were living life, the end I mean. You don ' t really have time, or even the will, to try to comprehend all of the overpoweringâ€¦ endness of it all. It consumes you until you simply are not there, and there ' s nothing you can even begin to think of doing since there really isn ' t a ' you ' anymore. Just unfathomable cosmic darkness and nothing.

I understand now. All the fuss about religion and the afterlife, whatever that was supposed to mean, was perfectly clear. The great survival instinct of humanity has branded them to think outside of the logical and in to the unfathomable. " How could one just ' not be '. There must be something after all of it, right? " They proclaim at their darkest moments of despair.

And now here I am, standing, watching flames and asteroids overtake the small, meaningless planet. The universe didn ' t really care did it? I don ' t know why I ' m even bothering to care about it. I suppose in all the planets smallness, there was a charm to everything. They all had the lovable, but maddeningly stubborn want to be important. Sending rovers and voyagers in space to try to find somebody, anybody really, who would care about them. Even amongst themselves, having to fight to become something, again anything, in someone else ' s mind. It is a quaint, yet irrefutably sympathetic struggle, I had grown to care for over the years. And now, what did that struggle bring them to. A blue ball of fire, with no destination. Never ending darkness. I suppose it was worth it while it lasted, but in the long run all of it seems so depressingly wasted. All of the moments, lost in the darkness of endlessness.

A woman of some name, which I don ' t care to remember, lest I shed an all too familiar tear. I didn ' t even know I could.
