Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action.

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

I ' m very close to not being sane currently, as a matter of fact, as I watch the last soul on the planet fade away. The cold, tear-ridden, gaze of the woman representing over a trillion years of evolution, life, emotion and culture now vanishing from existence, just as a fly with a swift swat.\n\nI don ' t really know what to feel. As I said ' they ' just said I couldn ' t, so that was that. I just simply didn ' t. For the trillions of years those lovably flawed beings lived on that little blue ball of theirs, I had grown to call my home, I swiftly and skilfully lead every life on that planet to eternal darkness, without thinking about it further. And now, the feeling of unprecedented sadness I could perceive through the emotions of people witnessing loved ones go, as I took them for my own, enfolds me an uncountable times over. The thought of the ultimate end had never struck me before. I knew the end was coming, sure, but to actually have it happen? It seemed impossible at the time. I suppose we are the same in a lot of ways, them and I. They didn ' t expect it either while they were living life, the end I mean. You don ' t really have time, or even the will, to try to comprehend all of the overpowering\u2026 endness of it all. It consumes you until you simply are not there, and there ' s nothing you can even begin to think of doing since there really isn ' t a ' you ' anymore. Just unfathomable cosmic darkness and nothing.\n\nI understand now. All the fuss about religion and the afterlife, whatever that was supposed to mean, was perfectly clear. The great survival instinct of humanity has branded them to think outside of the logical and in to the unfathomable. \" How could one just ' not be '. There must be something after all of it, right? \" They proclaim at their darkest moments of despair.\n\nAnd now here I am, standing, watching flames and asteroids overtake the small, meaningless planet. The universe didn ' t really care did it? I don ' t know why I ' m even bothering to care about it. I suppose in all the planets smallness, there was a charm to everything. They all had the lovable, but maddeningly stubborn want to be important. Sending rovers and voyagers in space to try to find somebody, anybody really, who would care about them. Even amongst themselves, having to fight to become something, again anything, in someone else ' s mind. It is a quaint, yet irrefutably sympathetic struggle, I had grown to care for over the years. And now, what did that struggle bring them to. A blue ball of fire, with no destination. Never ending darkness. I suppose it was worth it while it lasted, but in the long run all of it seems so depressingly wasted. All of the moments, lost in the darkness of endlessness.\n\nA woman of some name, which I don ' t care to remember, lest I shed an all too familiar tear. I didn ' t even know I could."

The domain and problem compiled, but the planner failed to find a solution or timed out. (Note: There are a few common solutions. Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"
