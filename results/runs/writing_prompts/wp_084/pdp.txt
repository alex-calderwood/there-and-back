A rumor spread around town about a magical pill that granted complete honesty and courage to the one who took it. The protagonist, having heard of this, felt that this could be the opportunity they had been waiting for. They decided to use this mysterious pill to finally confess their love to the love-interest.

As fate would have it, the love-interest one day confronted the protagonist. "Do you love me?" they asked.
