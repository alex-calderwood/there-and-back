I was pacing all around my room. " I love that man " was all that I could think of over and over again for the last hour. My head was throbbing, it needed to get this thought out of its system. If only I wasn't a coward. If only I had the words to tell him, to tell him how insanely infatuated I was with him. His voice made me tremble and his gleaming smile infected me with pure joy. He was worse than nicotine. He was the type of drug that would kill me. I couldn't hold this any longer, I couldn't hide this anymore.
I stared at the pill, it was taunting me. It laughed at me, pressuring me to ingest it. In that split second I said to myself, " fuck it, " and I took it. I gulped. The moment of truth would come any minute, when the screeching doorbell would ring. What happened after this would determine everything. It was either a win or a fall. And it was then when I found myself standing in front of him. His physique impeccable. I opened my mouth to talk, but no words came out. It was as if something had obstructed my airway. I choked. He was waiting, waiting for my response. Last night I made a promise that earlier I had regretted, but now it was all my body wanted to do.
" You said you would answer my question. " He stated in a monotonous voice.
" I did, didn't I? " I responded, stupidly.
" Do you love me? " It was there, no running away from the truth anymore. My mouth spoke before my mind could analyze. Every word I poured out of my body was like I was spitting out water after being drowned. I was walking closer to him by the second.
" I do, I have for the past three years and probably will fore the ones to come. I love you so much. I love your voice, and the way you say things with much confidence. I love the way you hold my hand gently and pet my hair. I love the way you kiss my nose and when you stare at my eyes as if we were the only two people in this universe. I love the way you tenderly grasp my head while kissing my lips. When I 'm with you I can't even imagine anywhere I 'd rather be. With you, I peak. You know every part of me and I know even the smallest freckle in your body. I can't imagine a world where I 'm not with you, much worse, a world without you. It's nonsense. It's unreal, a nightmare. I love you, do you? Do you love me with the passion that I do?
