I know you don't believe me, but I 'm here for you. I always have been, waiting for you to notice, for you to need me. It's who I am as a person, I 'm here to help my friends. And you, you 're a friend. Someone who needs my help. But do you know you need my help?

Your smile is gone, the smile that everyone loves. What can I do to bring it back? Talk to me, please, tell me what is wrong. Take your time, I have all day. Anything for a friend.

Your laugh, I have n't heard that in forever. I don't think anybody has. It brightens everyone's day. But we 've gone so long without it. It's not your fault, forgive me if I made it seem like is. But we all miss you. We all hate to see you like this, and we all want to help. Some don't know how to help, and they don't want to make things worse. Perhaps I don't truly know how to help, either. But you can be sure that I will try.

I 'm here for you, though, even if you feel like nobody is. I 'll always be. When you 're ready to smile again, I want to be the first to see it. When you 're ready to laugh, I would like to be the cause of it. You may feel that hope has forsaken you, but we, your friends, will never.
