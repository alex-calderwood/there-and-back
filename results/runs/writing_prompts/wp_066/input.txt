Dr. Vertigo stands on the lawn outside the UN building in a force field as he flips his gloved hand into a downward position. A moment later, an horde of minibots begin tearing the building apart, forming a ball to roll groups of people over, starting fires, pushing people out of windows, shooting small but lethal lasers, and generally causing as much damage as possible. He fingers his control rod and selects one of several pre-programmed commands it offers. " Capture Secretary General " glows for a moment in the display built into his contact lens.

Bullets bounce off his force field as security fires upon him. They only manage one or two shots as the minibots use the gunfire sound to locate and terminate them. Dr. Vertigo marches into the building to view his handiwork. The minibots swarm around, killing or incapacitating anyone showing resistance, and cutting through walls and ceilings looking for the Secretary General. Vertigo taps his foot as he waits for his bots to find the target and looks at this watch knowing he only has a few minutes before US military forces arrive.

The minibots declare they 've found Ki-Moon but he's barricaded in a safe room on the second floor. Vertigo runs towards the stairs and falls over as the building is rocked by heavy artillery. He picks himself up, swears, and finds his cape caught on something. A wounded intern has grabbed his cape and yells " Why? Why did you do this? WHY !? ! " as tears run down her face.

Vertigo carefully pulls his cape from her weak grip, stands stiffly, smiles and says, " The same reason all men do bad things. For wealth and power, of course. Has n't working at the UN taught you anything? " He then stares at her for a moment, sees her horrified facial expression, and savagely stomps her face with his boot as she crumples onto the floor. He then makes his way up to the second floor, cackling all the way.
