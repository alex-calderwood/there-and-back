Once upon a time, in a quiet little town, lived a protagonist, an ordinary man with an extraordinary burden. Unbeknownst to the townsfolk, the protagonist was haunted by spirits that constantly tormented his soul.

As the days passed, the protagonist could feel his life slipping away. The spirits sucked away his energy, leaving him weak and frail. He could barely recognize himself in the mirror as the man he once was.

The spirits whispered in his ear, sowing seeds of doubt and despair. Their presence poisoned his relationships with others; even the love of his life could not withstand the constant strain. With a heavy heart, he ended up driving away his lover, leaving him more alone and desperate than ever.

In his darkest hour, the protagonist found himself at the gates of an asylum. The whispers of the spirits became louder, urging him to seek refuge within its walls. He couldn't take it anymore and gave in, entering the asylum in search of solace.

Desperate for relief, the protagonist finally mustered the courage to confront the spirits that plagued him. He cried out to them, asking them to leave him be. To his surprise, the spirits faded into the shadows, releasing their hold on their captive's mind and soul.

Though he had achieved the impossible and rid himself of the spirits, the damage they had caused remained. He was now weakened in body and spirit, his love forever lost, and trapped within the confines of the asylum. While the spirits no longer haunted him, the memories of their torments lingered, serving as a constant reminder to the protagonist of the man he used to be and the life he left behind.
