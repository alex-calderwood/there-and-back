It was over. They were all gone. Except for her.
The war had ended, it ended the day the army began to collapse and side with the rebellion but it had taken time for them to turn completely against the crown. It had been six months of bloodshed, hatred and anger. When it all began, the army would crush the rebels but each defeat only fuled their cause and soon, they had an army of their own, nobility had begun supporting their cause, providing weapons, trained men and supplies and as the war raged on, more nobels allied with the rebellion. The capital city had fallen three days ago, when the gatemen revealed who's side they had taken. Once inside the walls of the city, the rebels found support from all within : peasants rejoyced, merchants welcomed them, soldiers salluted them and the King's Knights, his own personal guard, knelt before the rebel army, with only one man remaining by the King and his family. After that, it was only a matter of time before the castle fell into their hands and the king was slain in his throne room ; he was not given the dignity of a formal execution, his family however, were. The queen had been executed on the first day of the new regeim, the Prince and his newly-wed bride on the second and now, finally, on the third day it was the turn of the Princess and the one Knight. As the Princess made her way to the gallows, a fate that her father had sentenced so many to, her Knight began to shield her from the mob. " DEATH ! ! " the crowd began to roar and as missiles began to fly, her Knight raised his cloak and shield to protect her from the barrage. She didn't even know the man's name and he was shielding her, when he could have better protected himself. When they reached the gallows, two more knights approached him and dragged him away, he knew his fate as did the Princess, now at the foot of the Gallows, resigned to her fate.
