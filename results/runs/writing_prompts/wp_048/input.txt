Sonnet Number Twenty-One

You 've died. As Death, I 'll give you just one chance
To reclaim life from my grasps, face your fears.
You 'll choose from just three tasks your stance,
If you prefer to suffer Blood, Sweat or Tears.

The trial of Blood is Hell itself, just dire.
You 'll burn in a baptismal flame, be reborn,
Not know the man who 'll come from out the fire
In pain and suffering find a new form.

If effort suits your soul some more, you 'll help
In others ' underworld rebirth with Sweat.
You 'll build our torture chambers, be my whelp
And see humanity replaced with regret.

The final option left is to collapse
Into a puddle filled with Tears at last.
