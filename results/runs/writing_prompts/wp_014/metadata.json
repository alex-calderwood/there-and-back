Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive to generate a story plan.\n\nMake sure that in the generated domain and problem:\n  Common .pddl syntax should compile. All paranthesis must pair so that the domain and solution can be parsed as separate entities.\n  Objects initialized as constants cannot be redeclared in :init.\n  All predicates used in :actions must exist in :predicates.\n  All predicates declared in :predicates must be used at least once in :actions. Predicates that are unused should be deleted or the domain should be updated to use them consistently.\n  Any predicates that should be true at the start of the story should be included in :init.\n  Constants used by the domain should be declared in the domain. For example: (:constants treasure ring - item)\n  All :actions should adhere to common sense logic.\n  Most characters should have intentions, and these intentions should be declared using the :intentionality syntax in the problem, e.g. (intends character (alive character))\n  All actions should have effects that are used by other actions, character intentions, or the :goal of the author. If actions do not have effects, the domain should be revised for better logical consistency.\n\nOutput a well-formed domain and problem that can be parsed and run by Glaive:"

They believed that it would grant them supernatural powers and help them win the war.\n\nThe U.S., with spies everywhere, got wind of this and turned to Indiana Jones, renowned professor of archaeology, who happened to know the location of the ark in Tanis.\n\nIndiana, after very little convincing, started his journey with the Army from the U.S. to Tanis. They quickly pinpointed the location of the ark (exactly where Indy had predicted), and began to dig. Nazi influence in that region was already quite strong, and it quickly got back through their network. Indiana, unearthing an ancient cask from an inconspicuous burial site, felt confident that the mission was nearly complete. He was casual in travelling back to the U.S. and didn't take the necessary precautions to avoid being followed.\n\nThe Nazis, with their own spies, were on the tarmac by the time he landed, out of place on American soil. They took the ark from him at gunpoint, and took it to a secret location. They opened it, and were immediately killed by the wrath of God. The ark was then taken by the Army, and stored in a warehouse, where it probably sits to this day (unless it was stolen by aliens)."

I grab my helmet, jacket, keys, and slip out the door quietly. She ' ll tell me to stay home, to relax. I won ' t. I can ' t. I start the bike ; it ' s loud. New pipes, I just put them on the other day. They sound good. She hears it, I ' m sure. I leave.\n\nI drive down to the coast, a quick ride this time of the day. The roads are almost empty. It ' s evening, almost dusk. I need to stop for gas. The cashier is beautiful. She could be a model, or an actress. She ' s a cashier. She ' s looking at me strangely. Is it my turn to talk? I thank her, and I ride East.\n\nMy demons follow ; I ride to leave them behind. It ' s just beginning to get dark, but it ' s still summer. Tourists line the beach, drinking beer from coolers and watching the sun set and holding hands and relaxing. It looks like hell.\n\nI want only to live now, free of yesterday and tomorrow. I ride and live in the first person, present tense, oblivious. I have not ridden ; I will not be riding. I ride. The familiar, pleasant wind brushes my face and the tips of my fingers, reassuring. I check my mirrors, but the demons remain. They look angry, and they ride fast.\n\nIt is dark now. My high beams illuminate the mangled forests to the sides of the road. The trees bend in unison, reliving a trauma more than a decade old. Their shadows melt into one another, shifting as I pass, memories of a time and place I leave behind. I did not leave them behind, and I will not be leaving them. I leave them behind, now, and their forgiveness is mine to suffer alone.\n\nThe bay is alight with warfare, illuminated in that way only modern weapons flash and glow. The battleship fires its cannon skyward, but the monsters lurk below. I accelerate.\n\nA corner comes faster than expected ; I lean into the turn. If I will lean, I die. If I did lean, I would be safe. Instead, I lean, and narrowly survive. It is good. I continue. I check my mirrors. Where are the demons?\n\nAn eagle perches on my handlebars. \" The end is near, \" it tells me. \" Fuck you, bird, \" I reply.\n\n\" Please, come with me, and understand. \"\n\nI cross a small creek on a dilapidated bridge. The fish judge, and the crickets speak hate into an empty landscape, empty except for and including me. I trust the eagle. I go with him.\n\nSoaring, I gaze down on the landscape from a new perspective. The fish are amazed. The crickets speak hate. Up here, my life appears small, like an ant. I can think. Flight is not relaxing. It focuses me.\n\nIt is morning. I am lying in a field. I haven ' t lain, and I won ' t lie tomorrow. Where is my bike? No matter. The dew soaks my clothes, and the horizon awakens, and the stars begin to fade, and I lie. Is this ' relaxing '? Probably not. I like this.\n\nThe remaining stars come into focus, and grow. They are not stars. They are lights, intense, obnoxious, and they are for me. Aliens? No, there are no aliens here. A wind buffets my face, but not my fingers. It is not the familiar wind, not the pleasant one, not reassuring.\n\nLit by his lights in the sky, a serpent descends and offers his staff. I am enveloped, and lifted, once again. Am I going to heaven or to hell? Am I already there? \" Which one? \" I ask the serpent. \" Neither, buddy, \" he says, \" We ' re going to help you. Everything ' s going to be okay. Just try to relax. \"\n\nI don ' t want to relax. I can ' t. But I close my eyes, and try."

Ensure that characters have intentions that will lead to them taking actions that will fulfill the author's :goal. If there is not a clear sequence of motivated character actions that will solve the author's :goal, the planner will not be able to find a solution. One potential fix is to add character intentions to the problem. Another fix is to add or relax author goals such that at least one character's intentions will produce a sequence of motivated actions that will achieve each predicate within the author's :goal. Characters will not take actions for which they are an :agent if the action does not help them achieve an intention. For actions that exist independently of a character's volition, remove the :agent tag, or add intentions to the character.)"

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan is a list of character actions and story events that was generated from the domain and problem. It expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints.\n\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true:\n    (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate)\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will output a one-page natural language story in an engaging style using the provided domain, problem, and plan as a guide. All of the events in the plan must be present in your story in the correct order.\n\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with the provided story plan. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story, and the plan as the chronological ordering of events. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."

Predicates are assumed to be false by default if not specified in the problem statement.\nEach action specifies the preconditions that must be true before it can be executed, the effects that become true after it is executed, and optionally a list of agents who must intend to execute the action.\nThe problem specifies the objects in the storyworld (that aren't pre-defined constants), the initial state of the world, and the author's goal for the storyworld.\nThe plan can be generated from the domain and problem, and expresses what happens in the storyworld to solve the author's goals given the constraints. You won't have access to the plan, but should generate stories that adhere to a plan that could be generated from the constraints of the domain and problem.\n\nGlaive, an intentional planner for story domains, supports the following standard PDDL planning features:\n  :strips                       STRIPS-style actions\n  :negative-preconditions       Negated preconditions and goals\n  :typing                       Hierarchical typed constants\n  :equality                     Equality and inequality predicates\n  :disjunctive-preconditions    'or' preconditions and goals\n  :existential-preconditions    'exists' preconditions and goals\n  :universal-preconditions      'forall' preconditions and goals\n  :quantified-preconditions     :existential-preconditions and :universal-preconditions\n  :universal-effects            'forall' effects\n  :conditional-effects          'when' effects\n  :adl                          :strips, :negative-preconditions, :typing, :equality, :quantified-preconditions :universal-effects, and :conditional-effects\n  :domain-axioms                Automatic changes to the state\n\nGlaive also supports a some non-standard features, which create predicates that do not need to be expressed in the domain.\n\n:expression-variables\n  Variables my be type 'expression,' meaning theycan be bound to any logical expression, or of type 'imposable' meaning they can be bound toany expression which is a valid effect.\n:intentionality\n  Operators can declare a list of :agents, each of whom must intend that action. Intentionality creates a built in predicate 'intends' which models a character intending to make a predicate true: (intends ?character - character ?predicate - predicate). Do not re-define an 'intends' predicate in the domain.\n:delegation\n  Provides the 'delegated' modality and an axiom for performing goal delegation.\n\nYou will produce a one-page story that is logically consistent with a hypothetical story plan produced by the domain and problem. It should use the provided domain as an ontology from which to base the events in the story. The initial conditions should be consistent with those in the problem. \n\nThe style is largely up to your choosing. You are free to match or come up with genre forms based on the storyworld, or chooose to introduce your own authorial voice. Feel free to be original, as your writing is being judged on both stylistic creativity and logical consistency with the storyworld."
