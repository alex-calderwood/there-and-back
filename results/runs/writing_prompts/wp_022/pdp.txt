Jimmy was well known in his group of friends for his sense of humor and love of pranks. He was always pulling something on someone, and it was only a matter of time before someone sought revenge.

J-Frantz, a close friend of Jimmy, had been one of his victims before, and he decided it was finally his turn to catch Jimmy off guard. He spent days devising a prank that would outdo anything Jimmy had ever pulled off before. He figured the only way to get Jimmy for good was to hit him where it would hurt most: his phone.

That evening, J-Frantz hatched his plan. As they hung out together, J-Frantz skillfully maneuvered the conversation around to embarrassing stories, knowing that Jimmy would be distracted by trying to one-up their friends' tales. While Jimmy laughed along with the group, J-Frantz reached for Jimmy's unattended phone and quickly typed out a message to every contact, saying, "Hey, it's me, Jimmy! I'm a chicken!"

J-Frantz grinning ear to ear, put the phone back in its spot without getting caught. The plan was in motion.

As they parted ways for the night, J-Frantz anxiously awaited the fallout. It wasn't long before notifications began rolling in on Jimmy's phone, as confused friends and family members responded to his chicken declaration.

To everyone's surprise, Jimmy took the prank in stride, laughing along with his friends as they made chicken jokes at his expense. J-Frantz could hardly contain his satisfaction, and with a sly grin, he finally admitted to being the mastermind behind the prank. In that moment, J-Frantz had achieved his goal: for once, Jimmy was the one who was pranked instead of the prankster.

Little did J-Frantz know, Jimmy was already plotting his next move, determined to regain his title as the ultimate prankster.
