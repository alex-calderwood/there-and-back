Hey Matt,

I know you 're hurting. I know you 're struggling. You tell yourself you can do it, you 're going to change the world, you 're going to do this and that and you end up doing it. You know telling yourself that its hard and painful isn't going to help so you tell yourself its easy and that you can do it. I get it, you say you do something and you plow forward to do it. BUT right now, please just let yourself bask in the moment -- this moemnt right here of raw emotino. This is you, this is where you 're at right now. It hurts and you still loved her but you needed to let go of this one. She wasnt ready. There was too much on the line with this one. Matt, I know you loved her. You gave it your 100 % and you can't say that about some things, but know that you did everything you possibly could -- so please let her go for the sake of you. Times are rough. but they will get better. i promise you that. so please. let yourself free.

Love,
Yourself
