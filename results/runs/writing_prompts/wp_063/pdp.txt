In a world where every individual's death was inexorably predetermined, the only hope of survival was to avert the seemingly unavoidable fate. Three friends, the protagonist, Pat, and Stephen, were fully aware of their impending doom, therefore, they decided to join forces and help each other escape the clutches of death.

The protagonist, the daring one among the three, went ahead and formulated a plan to call the police for assistance. They believed that if the military officer were to arrive on the scene, they would have a better chance of changing their grim futures. Pat, the quickest thinker of the group, took the initiative and called the police. As he desperately explained the situation, an officer was dispatched to their location.

While waiting for the military officer to arrive, Pat decided to follow the protagonist, believing that their combined strength would help them overcome any obstacles. Little did they know, the officer, sensing their distress, went to room2 adjacent to their location.

Stephen, the most cautious of the three, decided to follow the protagonist as well, hoping that by staying together, they could all avert their impending demise. Realizing that every second counted, Stephen quickly called the police, requesting backup to ensure their survival. At that moment, they were all determined to escape their looming fate.

The officer heard the calls for help and swiftly arrived at the scene. Pat was the first to avert his death, feeling a sudden and inexplicable surge of relief. Stephen, heart racing, averted his death shortly after. Finally, the protagonist, the mastermind behind the plan, followed the military officer and averted their own death.

The three friends, united and strengthened by their life-altering experiences, embraced the course of action they took. They were grateful for their newfound appreciation of life and the unbreakable bond they formed. The world's oppressive grip failed to triumph over their determination, and they emerged victorious against the inescapable claws of fate.
