In a small, remote building, three friends - the protagonist, Pat, and Stephen - huddled together in Room1, terrified. They had heard whispers of a deadly curse looming over the place, and they were desperate to avoid meeting their untimely ends. 

Out of sheer panic, they decided to lock the door to Room1, believing they could keep the threat at bay. They locked it with haste but realized that they would be trapped inside without any definitive way out. The protagonist, not willing to give up without a fight, decided to be more proactive. 

Refusing to simply wait in fear, the protagonist called the police, who responded promptly. The authorities sent a seasoned military officer to investigate the bizarre situation. The officer arrived on the scene and took charge, surveying the building and finally reaching Room2.

With hope and determination burning in their hearts, the protagonist, Pat, and Stephen chose to follow the officer's every move. They hoped that sticking close to the officer would be their best chance at survival, as he was well-equipped and skilled in handling threats.

The group, now led by the officer, navigated through the building, taking all necessary precautions. They dodged potential dangers, made use of every possible escape route, and fought off any looming threats. In the end, their diligence and the officer's expertise paid off, allowing them to avert their deaths and escape the cursed building.

The three friends were relieved and grateful, having survived the ordeal by trusting in the officer and their own determination. They vowed never again to venture into such a dangerous situation, but they also understood the importance of never giving up and working together in the face of adversity.
