Once upon a time, in a small house, lived a girl named Lily. Lily loved to read. She read books all day long. Her room was very organized. She had a special place for all her books.
One day, Lily found a big box. The box was full of soap. She thought it was funny. She decided to use the soap to make her room even more organized. Lily put the soap on her bookshelf, next to her books.
As Lily read her books, she would smell the soap. It made her feel happy. Her friends came to play and they loved how her room smelled. They all wanted to read books and smell the soap too. Lily's room became the best place to be.
