Once upon a time, two friends decided to go and explore the world. One day, they decided to go and visit a volcano. They were both very excited! When they got there, they saw an old man counting coins.
The two friends started to laugh, since they thought it was funny. But the old man got mad and yelled at them. He told them off for being so rude.
The two friends realised it was not very nice to laugh at someone, and so, they apologized to the old man. From that day on, the two friends learned to always be kind and courteous to people, no matter what.
The moral of the story is to always be nice and polite to everyone. Counting coins may seem funny, but it’s not nice to laugh at someone who is counting. Respect other people’s feelings and be kind.
