Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to play with yarn. One day, Kitty found a big ball of yarn. She was very happy. But she was also a bit nervous. She thought, "Will I manage to play with this big ball of yarn?"
Kitty tried to play with the big ball of yarn. She pushed it and rolled it. But the ball was too big for her. Kitty was sad. She thought, "Maybe I can't manage to play with this big ball of yarn."
Then, Kitty had an idea. She asked her friend, Doggy, to help her. Doggy was big and strong. He could help Kitty manage the big ball of yarn. Doggy pushed the ball with his nose. The ball rolled and rolled. Kitty and Doggy played with the big ball of yarn. They were very happy.
Kitty was not nervous anymore. She knew that with the help of her friend, she could manage to play with the big ball of yarn. And from that day on, Kitty and Doggy played with the big ball of yarn every day. They had lots of fun together.
