Once upon a time there was a girl who was gifted. She had the most perfect feathery skin and was able to do many things.
One day she was exploring in a forest and found an old house. She carefully opened the door and stepped inside.
Suddenly a voice spoke to her and said "Kneel before me." She was very scared, but she kneeled. The voice said that if she did something special and gifted then he would reward her.
The girl was so excited and tried her best. But when she looked up, the voice said he was not happy and that he would take away her skin.
The girl was very upset and ran away as fast as she could. The voice never gave her a reward and she had to live with no skin. The bad ending made her sad and she vowed to never visit the old house again.
