Once upon a time, there was a big sun who was very generous. Every day, the sun would tell the little plants and animals to wake up and play. The sun gave them heat to help them grow and be happy.
One day, the sun saw a small seed in the ground. The sun knew that the seed needed heat to grow into a big, strong tree. So, the sun gave the seed lots of heat and the seed started to grow. The sun was happy to see the seed grow into a little plant.
As the days went by, the little plant grew bigger and bigger. It grew into a strong tree with many branches and leaves. The tree gave shade to the animals and a home for the birds. The tree was very thankful to the sun for its generous heat.
The moral of the story is that when you are generous and help others, they can grow and become strong too.
