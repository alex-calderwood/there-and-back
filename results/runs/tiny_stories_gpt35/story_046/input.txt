Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot was very impatient. He always wanted to run and play with his ball. One day, Spot saw a bottle of perfume on the table. It smelled very nice. Spot wanted to smell like the perfume, too.
Spot tried to jump up to the table to get the perfume. He jumped and jumped, but he could not reach it. Spot did not give up. He wanted to succeed, so he tried again and again. He jumped higher and higher.
Finally, Spot jumped high enough and got the perfume. He was so happy that he succeeded. Spot smelled like the nice perfume all day long. Now, Spot was not only an impatient dog, but also a sweet-smelling dog. And he played with his ball all day long.
