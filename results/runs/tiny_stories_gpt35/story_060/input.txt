Once upon a time, there was a big vase. The vase was red and pretty. It lived in a nice house with a happy family. The family liked to put pretty flowers in the vase. 
One day, a delicious smell came into the house. It was from a big cake that Mom was making. The cake was for a fun party. The vase wanted to join the party too.
So, the family put the vase on the table with the big cake. The vase had pretty flowers in it. Everyone at the party liked the vase and the delicious cake. The vase was happy to join the fun party. And they all had a great time together.
