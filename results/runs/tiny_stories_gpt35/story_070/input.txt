One day, a big dog saw a small cat. The cat had a nice wrap. The dog wanted the wrap. So, the dog tried to steal it. The cat saw the dog and said, "No, that is my wrap!"
The dog felt bad and said, "I am sorry. I will not steal your wrap." The cat thought the dog was serious. They became friends and played together. They had lots of fun.
But then, something unexpected happened. The wrap fell into a puddle! The cat and dog were both sad. But they worked together to clean the wrap. The cat and dog were happy again. They learned that stealing is bad and being friends is good.
