Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a secret. Lily knew where the best flowers grew. She would go to the secret flower place and pick the prettiest ones for her mom.
One day, Lily's friend, Tim, asked her, "Where do you find those pretty flowers?" Lily thought for a moment. She was patient and wanted to share her secret with her friend. So, she said, "I can show you, but it's a secret. You must not tell anyone else."
Tim agreed and they went to the secret flower place. Tim was so happy to see all the beautiful flowers. He suggested, "Let's pick some for our moms and dads." Lily liked the idea. They both picked the prettiest flowers for their parents.
When they got back, they gave the flowers to their moms and dads. Their parents were so happy and proud of them. Lily and Tim felt good about sharing their secret flower place with each other. And they promised to always be patient and kind to their friends.
