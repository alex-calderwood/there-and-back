Once upon a time, there was a gifted giraffe named Stretch. Stretch was the tallest one in the safari and he proudly stood out amongst the other animals. 
One sunny day, Stretch decided to take a walk amongst the other animals. He strutted through the grass with his long legs and spotted a group of hippos chatting. Stretch was curious and carefully approached the group.
One of the hippos noticed Stretch. "Hello there!" They said. "Where would you like to go on your walk today?" 
Stretch put his long neck towards the sky and smiled, "I would like to explore new places."
The hippos were intrigued. "That's a fantastic idea," they exclaimed. Stretch smiled and waved goodbye to the hippos before walking off to explore the safari and find new places. 
Stretch was so happy and felt so blessed to be so gifted! He was one of a kind and loved the safari's beauty. He looked forward to more adventures and exploring even further.
