Once upon a time there was a very smart little girl. She was looking for something to wear. She opened her drawer full of clothes, and saw a pretty dress. It was red with yellow flowers and it was so pretty! She decided to put it on. 
She put on the dress and it fit perfectly. She slid her feet into her shoes and they were comfy too. She looked in the mirror and felt so great. 
But then, suddenly, her foot slipped on the floor and she felt herself falling. Her dress was still on, but it had a big hole in it. She was so sad! 
But then, her mum came in and gave her a hug. She said, "Don't worry! You're still so smart in your dress!" She took her daughter to the shop to get her a new dress. 
The little girl found a dress with pink roses. It was even more beautiful than before. She put it on and it fit perfectly too. She looked in the mirror and smiled. She was so happy! 
The little girl had a great day wearing her new dress, and she never slipped again.
