One day, a little boy named Tim found a penny on the floor. It was a very old penny. It was not like the other pennies he had seen before. He thought it was an original penny. Tim was very happy to find it.
He wanted to buy a candy with the penny. Tim went to the store with the penny in his hand. But the store man said, "This penny is not good here. It is too old." Tim was sad, but he did not give up. He wanted to succeed in buying the candy.
Tim went to another store. There, he met a nice old lady. She looked at the penny and said, "This is a special penny. I will give you a big candy for it." Tim was so happy! He got the candy and the old lady got the original penny. In the end, Tim succeeded and everyone was happy.
