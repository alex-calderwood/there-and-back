Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jack. Jack was three years old and he loved playing with his friends. One day Jack went to his friend's house for a snack. His friend was very nice and he offered Jack a snack.
But when Jack took the snack, his friend smiled and said that the snack was really a lie. Jack was really sad and he began to cry. His friend, who was usually compassionate, just stood there and laughed.
Jack was so upset that he ran away and didn't look back. He was sad and he couldn't understand why his friend would do such a cruel thing. He was very disappointed in his friends and he never even looked back. 
Jack learned a lesson that day. He learned to be more careful and to always look out for people who might lie to him. He also learned that not all people are compassionate.
