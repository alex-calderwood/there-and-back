In a small village, lived a young woman named Talia. She was beautiful and kind-hearted, and named the most eligible bachelorette in the village. Two men, Rory and Vince, both vied for her love. Rory was a humble, sweet man who had won her heart, while Vince was a wealthy, cunning man who sought to win her hand in marriage solely for her beauty.

Talia and Rory deeply loved each other, as fate would have it. However, for Talia, marriage meant ensuring a happy and prosperous life for herself as well. Rory, being a simple man, couldn't provide a lavish lifestyle for her, whereas Vince, the wealthiest man in the village, could. A dilemma it was, for her heart desired love as much as it did fortune.

In the neighboring mountains, there resided a fearsome monster named Gargax. This monster guarded a vast treasure in a hidden cave, making him the wealthiest creature of all. Tales of the treasure had reached the village, but those who dared to claim it had either never returned or met their tragic end.

One day, as Rory was strolling through the village, a brilliant idea struck him. If he could sneak into Gargax's cave and steal the treasure, he would become rich and be able to provide Talia with the life she deserved. With that, he could marry her. Full of determination, Rory set off on a daring and dangerous quest to steal the treasure from Gargax.

Meanwhile, Vince had hatched his plan to propose to Talia. He gathered the village and asked for her hand in marriage, presenting his wealth as a testament to the life he could offer her. Talia, torn between her love for Rory and the life Vince could provide, stalled her decision.

While in the mountains, Rory discovered the cave and skillfully evaded the traps guarding the entrance. As he entered, he saw Gargax, who was fast asleep. Stealing the treasure without waking the beast, Rory quickly made his way back to the village, filled with hope and excitement.

Upon reaching the village, Rory proposed to Talia with the treasure, proving his love and his newfound wealth. With her heart's two desires now within reach, Talia accepted Rory's proposal. The couple got married and lived a happy, prosperous life together.

Vince, defeated and heartbroken, continued to live his life in the village, while Gargax remained in his cave, unaware of his lost treasure.
