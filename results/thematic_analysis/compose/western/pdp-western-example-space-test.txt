Zoe was a brave explorer, navigating the cosmos in search of new planets and unknown creatures. Today her ship had landed close to an unusual landform on an uncharted planet. The surface of the new world seemed safe and habitable. With excitement, she prepared to teleport herself from the ship to the surface.

Upon arrival, she immediately noticed a strange creature that looked like a lizard. Though a bit alarming, she had no intention of hurting it. Zoe approached it peacefully and tried to befriend the lizard, which appeared to be the guardian of the landform. Much to her surprise, the lizard responded positively to her gestures, and they became friends.

As they bonded, the landform suddenly started to rumble. A volcano was about to erupt! Zoe knew she had to act fast to ensure her newfound friend's safety. The lizard seemed to have sensed the imminent danger as well. However, in a panic, the lizard attacked Zoe.

For her safety and with great regret, Zoe stunned the lizard. She then teleported herself back to her ship, just before the volcano erupted. The planet's surface became uninhabitable as the powerful eruption destroyed everything in its path.

Although she had successfully transported herself back to the ship, her new friend was left behind, stunned and vulnerable. Zoe wondered about the fate that had befallen the lizard, a creature she had hoped would remain a friend. But in the vastness of space, such friendships were as fleeting as the planets they explored, and there was no time to dwell on the past. Zoe took solace in the lessons she had learned and looked ahead to her next adventure.
