Hank, a cattle rancher, lived with his son, Timmy, on a ranch in a small western town. They developed a strong bond and looked after each other's back. Hank was the town's most beloved rancher, and Timmy always dreamt of following in his father's footsteps someday.

On the other hand, Will, the local sheriff, was known for keeping the town's law and order while sipping a drink at the saloon, plotting against criminals.

One day, on an ordinary trip to the general store to gather supplies, Timmy and Hank bumped into a rattlesnake. In trying to protect Hank, Timmy was bitten, and the snake slithered away. Hank panicked, knowing the danger of a snakebite, and rushed Timmy back home to the ranch while the venom started taking its toll.

News of Timmy's snakebite quickly spread through the town, and Carl, the storekeeper who had antivenom in the general store, grew anxious. Though Carl intended to keep the antivenom for his own safety, he knew the townspeople would be depending on him.

Desperate to save his son, Hank rode back to the general store to obtain the antivenom from Carl. Carl, feeling the guilt and responsibility, reluctantly gave the antivenom to Hank. Hank, filled with gratitude, thanked Carl and hurried back to the ranch.

However, time was against Hank, as the venom had already done significant damage to Timmy's body. By the time Hank reached the ranch, Timmy, despite fighting valiantly, had succumbed to the snakebite and lost his life.

Hank, devastated by the loss of his son, held the antivenom in his hands, unable to reverse the cruel fate that had befallen his family. In the end, although Hank had the antivenom, it was too late for Timmy, and he would forever mourn the loss of his beloved son.
