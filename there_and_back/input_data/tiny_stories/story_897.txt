One day, a small girl named Lily went for a walk in the woods. She saw three huts. She had to choose one to go in. The first hut was big, the second hut was small, and the third hut was light.
Lily chose the light hut because it looked nice. Inside the hut, she saw a big box. The box had a lock on it. Lily was curious about what was inside the box. She looked around the hut and found a key. She felt that the key could open the box.
Lily put the key in the lock and opened the box. Inside the box, there was a big, scary monster. The monster jumped out and scared Lily. She ran out of the hut as fast as she could. Lily should not have opened the box. She was sad and scared.
