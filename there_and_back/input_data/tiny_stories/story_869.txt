Once upon a time, there was a clumsy cat named Tom. Tom loved to play with his network of friends, but sometimes he would fall and make a mess. One day, Tom was playing with his friends when he saw a magic box.
Tom went to the box and said, "What is this?" The box opened and a voice said, "I am a magic box. I can make you shrink!" Tom was surprised and wanted to try it out. He asked the box to make him shrink, and suddenly, he became very small.
Now, Tom was tiny and his friends were big. They all laughed and said, "Tom, you are so small now!" Tom was scared at first, but then he realized that being small was fun. He could run faster and hide better. In the end, Tom and his friends had a great time playing together, and Tom was happy to be a tiny, clumsy cat.
