Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a girl named Lucy. Lucy had a pretty purse that she loved very much. One day, she went to the park to play with her friends. She took her purse with her.
While playing, Lucy saw a boy who looked troubled. He was sitting alone and looked sad. Lucy went to him and asked, "Why are you sad?" The boy said, "I lost my toy car, and I can't find it." Lucy started to wonder how she could help him.
Lucy looked in her purse and found a small toy car. She gave it to the boy, and he was very happy. They played together and became good friends. From that day on, Lucy always helped others when they were troubled. The moral of the story is that when we help others, we make friends and feel happy.
