Once upon a time, there was a big dance party. All the kids were happy and having fun. One girl named Lily was sad. She did not know how to dance. She wanted to dance like the other kids, but she was too shy.
Lily's mom had a camera. She took pictures of all the kids dancing. Lily saw the camera and had an idea. She asked her mom to take a picture of her dancing. Lily's mom said yes and smiled.
Lily stood in front of the camera and started to dance. She was still a little shy, but she tried her best. As she danced, something unexpected happened. All the kids stopped and watched Lily. They clapped and cheered for her. Lily was not sad anymore. She was happy, and she danced with her new friends all night long.
