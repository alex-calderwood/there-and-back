Once upon a time, there was a popular cat named Tom. Tom loved to mix things in a big bowl. One day, he went outside to play near the green hedge.
As Tom was walking, he saw his friend, a little bird named Sue. Sue asked, "What are you doing, Tom?" Tom replied, "I am going to mix some things in my big bowl. Do you want to help?" Sue said, "Yes, I would love to help!"
They started to mix things together in the big bowl. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. They looked up and saw a big, friendly dog named Max. Max had jumped over the hedge and landed in their big bowl! They all laughed and became good friends. From that day on, they always played together and had fun mixing things in the big bowl.
