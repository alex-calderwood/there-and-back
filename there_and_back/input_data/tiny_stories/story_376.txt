One day, Tom and his dad went to the beach. They wanted to see if they could find any otters.
Tom asked his dad, “What’s an otter?” 
His Dad replied, “They are cute animals that live in the ocean. They are a lot of fun to watch!” 
Suddenly, they heard a weird noise coming from the ocean. It sounded like a mix of a meow and a bark. Tom and his dad looked out and saw an otter. The otter was collecting shells from the beach and making a big pile. 
Tom and his dad watched the otter for a few minutes. They thought it was so weird the way the otter was collecting shells. 
They decided to go a little closer and get a better look. The otter looked up and smiled. Tom and his dad waved at the otter. The otter waved back and continued collecting shells. 
Tom and his dad watched the otter for a while more. Then they said goodbye and went back home. Tom was so excited to tell his mom and friends all about the weird otter collecting shells at the beach.
