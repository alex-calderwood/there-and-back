Once upon a time, there was a mysterious onion. It had a magical power - anyone who owned it would never be hungry! 
One day, a little boy saw the onion and was so excited. He had never seen an onion like this before. He wanted to own it so he decided to pick it up and take it home with him. 
The little boy was so happy to have the mysterious onion. He showed it to everyone he could think of, and all the adults in his life were so surprised! They told him to take good care of it. 
The little boy kept the mysterious onion close to him and made sure it was safe. As he grew up, he never forgot the onion and he was so glad he was the one who owned it. 
The little boy and his onion became the best of friends, and they were never hungry again!
