Lily and Tom were playing in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a scarf. They gave him a carrot nose and two coal eyes. They named him Frosty.
"Hello, Frosty!" Lily said. "You are our friend. We will play with you every day."
"Yes, we will," Tom said. "But we have to be careful. The sun is very bright. It can make you melt."
Frosty smiled. He liked Lily and Tom. They were very kind. But he was also scared. He did not want to melt. He wanted to stay with them.
One day, the sun was very hot. Lily and Tom went inside to have lunch. Frosty felt very warm. He saw a big puddle under his feet. He was melting!
"Oh no!" Frosty said. "I have to escape. I have to find a cold place."
He looked around. He saw a sled near the fence. He had an idea. He jumped on the sled and pushed it with his feet. The sled started to move. It went down the hill. It went very fast. It made a zoom sound.
"Zoom, zoom, zoom!" Frosty said. "This is fun. But where am I going?"
He saw a big lake at the bottom of the hill. The lake was icy. It was frozen. Frosty was happy. He thought he would be safe there.
But he was wrong. The ice was thin. It could not hold his weight. When he reached the lake, the ice cracked. Frosty fell into the water. He felt very cold. He felt very wet. He felt very sad.
"Help, help, help!" Frosty said. "I made a mistake. I want to go back. I want to see Lily and Tom."
But no one heard him. No one saw him. He sank into the water. He disappeared.
Lily and Tom came back from lunch. They looked for Frosty. They saw the sled near the lake. They saw the hole in the ice. They knew what happened.
"Oh no!" Lily said. "Frosty is gone. He escaped. He melted."
"That's so sad," Tom said. "We loved him. He was our friend."
They hugged each other. They cried. They learned a lesson. They learned that sometimes it is better to stay where you are. They learned that sometimes escaping is not the answer. They learned that sometimes you lose what you love.
