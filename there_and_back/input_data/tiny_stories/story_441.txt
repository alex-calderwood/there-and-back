Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Tom. Tom was only three years old and was curious about the world around him. One day, Tom decided to set up a little experiment in his bedroom. He found a roll of tape, and began to carefully tape pieces around his room.
Tom's mum came in to see what he was doing. She said, "Tom, what on earth are you doing?" 
Tom replied, "I'm trying to make a foolproof plan! I'm making it so the monsters can't get in." 
Tom's mum laughed and said, "You're so foolish, Tom! Monsters don't exist. But you like being creative!"
Tom smiled and said, "Okay. I'll set my experiment a different way then. This tape will keep me safe from bad dreams" 
Tom's mum smiled. She watched as Tom placed the tape on the doors and windows, happy that he was being creative and safe. 
The end!
