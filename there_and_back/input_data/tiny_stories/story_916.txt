Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot had a hurt paw. He wanted to heal and play with his friends.
One day, a kind lady saw Spot. She said, "Oh no, Spot! Your paw is hurt. I will help you heal." The kind lady had an available bandage. She put the bandage on Spot's paw.
Soon, Spot's paw began to feel better. He said, "Thank you, kind lady! My paw is healing." Now, Spot could play with his friends again. And they all lived happily ever after.
