One day, Bee was flying near her hive. She saw her friend Ant walking on the ground. Bee said, "Hi Ant! Want to come see my hive?"
Ant said, "Yes, I want to see it. But I can't fly like you. How can I come?" Bee thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea! I will find a way to help you come up."
Bee flew away to find something to help Ant. She saw a long leaf on a tree. Bee thought, "This leaf will help me get Ant to my hive." She flew back to Ant with the leaf.
Bee said, "Hold on tight, Ant! I will take you up to my hive." Ant held on to the leaf, and Bee flew up to the hive. When they got there, Ant saw all the yummy honey inside the hive. Ant said, "Wow, Bee! You have so much yummy honey!"
But then, a big bird came and tried to eat the hive. Bee and Ant were scared. They worked together to chase the bird away. After the bird was gone, they were happy and safe. Bee and Ant became best friends, and they shared the yummy honey.
