One day, a little boy named Tim found a big red triangle on the ground. He thought it was very pretty. Tim picked it up and took it home. He wanted to show it to his mom.
"Mom, look what I found!" Tim said. "It's a triangle!" His mom smiled and said, "That's nice, Tim. It's a tough triangle. Let's put it on the wall." Tim was very happy. They used a mark to draw a line where the triangle would go. Then, they put the triangle on the wall.
The next day, Tim woke up and saw the triangle was gone! He was sad. He asked his mom, "Where did the triangle go?" His mom looked at the wall and saw a door where the triangle was! She said, "Oh, Tim! The triangle was a magic door! Let's see what's inside." They opened the door and found a room full of toys! Tim and his mom were so surprised and happy. They played with the toys all day long.
