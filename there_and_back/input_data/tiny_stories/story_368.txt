Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim lived in a big city with lots of traffic. Every day, he would walk to the park with his mom. On their way, they would see many enormous buses and trucks.
One day, Tim saw a man with a sign. The man would raise the sign up and down. Tim asked his mom, "Mom, what is that man doing?" His mom replied, "He is helping the traffic go safely, Tim."
Tim thought that was a cool job. He told his mom, "I want to help the traffic too when I grow up!" His mom smiled and said, "You can be anything you want, Tim. Just always be kind and helpful to others." From that day on, Tim knew he wanted to be just like the man with the sign.
