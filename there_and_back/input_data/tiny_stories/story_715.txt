Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Lucy. She was always very cheerful and always wanted to do something different and exciting. One day she heard about a volcano for sale. 
"Mommy, can I buy the volcano?" asked Lucy, with a huge grin on her face. 
"Oh, I don't know, honey" her mom replied. "It's a very expensive purchase..." 
But Lucy was so cheerful and insistent that her mom finally said yes. So they drove to the volcano to take a look. 
When they arrived, they couldn't believe their eyes. It was an enormous volcano and it was spewing out all kinds of smoke and lava. Lucy was so excited, clapping her hands in joy and jumping up and down. 
"We'll buy it!" said Lucy's mom, and the nice man who was selling the volcano agreed. 
And that is how Lucy managed to get her very own volcano, much to her delight. They later found out that it was an active volcano and it often erupted, but this only adds to the fun for Lucy and her mom.
