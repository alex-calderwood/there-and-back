One day, a big bird named Oli the Ostrich was walking in the forest. He was looking for his good friend, Sam the Squirrel. Oli saw Sam up in a tree and called out, "Hi, Sam! Come down and play with me!"
Sam replied, "I am coming, Oli!" Sam jumped from the tree and they started to play. They had so much fun running and playing in the forest. After a while, they got tired and sat down to rest.
As they sat, they heard a loud noise. Oli and Sam looked around to see what it was. They saw a big box on the ground. Oli and Sam went to the box and opened it. Inside the box, they found a big cake! It was a surprise party for Oli and Sam. Their friends had planned it all along. Oli and Sam were so happy and had a great time at their party with all their friends.
