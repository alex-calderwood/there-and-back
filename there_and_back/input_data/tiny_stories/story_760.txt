Once upon a time, there was a big, wide tree in a small park. Under the tree, a little girl named Lily and her dog, Max, liked to play. They would run, jump, and laugh together. They loved to stay under the tree all day.
One sunny day, Lily said to Max, "I hope we can stay here forever." Max barked and wagged his tail. They played with a red ball and had lots of fun. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.
As the day went on, the sky turned dark, and it started to rain. Lily and Max had to go home. They said goodbye to the wide tree and ran home. They were sad, but they knew they could come back to play another day.
