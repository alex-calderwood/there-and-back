Once upon a time, there was a wild cat named Tom. Tom liked to play all day with his friend, a little bird named Sue. They lived in a big green forest with many trees.
One day, Tom and Sue found a needle on the ground. They did not know what it was. They wanted to show their friends, so they picked it up and carried it to their seat under a big tree.
While they were sitting, their friend Max, a big brown dog, came to see them. Max saw the needle and told them, "Be careful! Needles can hurt you." Tom and Sue thanked Max for telling them, and they put the needle in a safe place.
From that day on, Tom, Sue, and Max played together every day. They had many fun adventures, but they always remembered to be careful and watch out for each other.
