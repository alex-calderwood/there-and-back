Once upon a time, there lived a little princess named Claire. Claire lived in a wonderful castle with her family and the hardest working Queen anyone had ever seen. Every day, the queen would work hard to maintain the castle and make it a happy place for every one. 
One day, Claire saw her mother and father quarrel. She had never seen her parents fight before and it made her sad. She decided to go talk to the queen and asked her why her parents were quarreling. The queen sighed, looked at the princess and said, 
"Well, dear, it can be hard to understand. Sometimes, grownups get into arguments and it doesn't mean they don't love each other. They will make it up soon." 
Claire listened to the queen and nodded. She hugged her mom and dad and soon, the quarrel was over.  From that day on, Claire admired the queen for her wisdom and hard work. 
The End.
