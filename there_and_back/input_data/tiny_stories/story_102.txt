One day, a boy and his dog went to the park. They saw a big oak tree. The boy and his dog liked to play under the oak tree because the grass was soft.
The boy and his dog were playing with a ball. The dog would run and catch the ball. Then, the dog would bring the ball back to the boy. They were having a lot of fun.
But, one time, the ball went very high. It went up, up, up, and got stuck in the oak tree. The boy and his dog looked up. They saw a big bird take the ball from the tree. The bird flew down and gave the ball back to the boy. The boy and his dog were very happy. They said thank you to the bird and kept playing in the park.
