Once upon a time, a boy named Tom had a zip on his coat. He loved to zip it up and down. One day, Tom went to the store with his mom. They saw a big, cheap toy in the store. Tom wanted the toy, but his mom said no.
Tom was sad, but his mom had an idea. She said, "Let's make cocoa at home, and you can help me." Tom liked cocoa, so he said yes. They went home and made the cocoa together. Tom's mom let him zip the cocoa mix into the milk.
When they were done, Tom and his mom drank the cocoa. It was very good. Tom forgot about the cheap toy, because he was happy to have cocoa with his mom. They laughed and had fun, and Tom's zip on his coat went up and down.
