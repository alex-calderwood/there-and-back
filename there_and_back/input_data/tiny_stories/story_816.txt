Once upon a time, in a small house near the woods, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in the dirt. One sunny day, Tim went outside to play and found a big pile of dirty mud near the woods. He was very happy and decided to play in the dirty mud.
Tim started to spread the mud all over the ground. He made a big circle with the mud and pretended it was a castle. He found some pieces of wood and put them around the circle to make the walls of the castle. Tim was having so much fun playing in the dirty mud and building his castle.
After a while, Tim's mom called him inside for lunch. Tim looked at his hands and saw that they were very dirty from the mud. He knew he had to wash his hands before eating. Tim went inside, washed his hands, and enjoyed his lunch. After lunch, Tim went back outside to play with his muddy castle near the woods. He had a great day playing in the dirt and using his imagination.
