Once upon a time, there was an adorable dog named Spot. Spot loved to play in the yard with his red ball. One sunny day, he saw a big spade near the garden.
Spot thought it would be fun to dig with the spade. He picked it up with his mouth and started to dig a big hole. He dug and dug until he was very tired. Soon, the hole was so big that Spot could sit in it.
Just then, Mom came out of the house. She saw the big hole and said, "Oh no, Spot! We need to shut this hole!" Mom and Spot worked together to fill the hole with dirt. When they were done, they both sat down and laughed. Spot was happy to help Mom and play with the spade.
