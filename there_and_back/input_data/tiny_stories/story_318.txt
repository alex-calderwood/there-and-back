Once upon a time there was a little girl called Rachel. She was a brave and curious girl. One day she decided to explore the world around her. 
As she was exploring, she saw something very exciting: a tornado in the far away sky! Rachel was mesmerized and shouted out loud. "It's so clear!"
Rachel's parents came to see what was happening. They were a bit scared but curious too. "Should we taste it?" Rachel asked her parents. 
But her parents knew that it was too dangerous to get too close to a tornado. "No, Rachel, we can't do that. We must stay here and be safe," said her mom. 
Rachel was disappointed but she still enjoyed the sight of the tornado from afar. It was amazing to watch and Rachel could learn so much from it. 
And that's the story of how brave little Rachel discovered the tornado in the clear sky.
