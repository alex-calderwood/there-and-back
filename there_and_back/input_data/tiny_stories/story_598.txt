Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a tiger named Tim. Tim was a competitive tiger who liked to race with his friends. One day, he met a rabbit named Ron who also loved to race.
Tim said, "I recommend we have a race to see who is the fastest." Ron agreed and they started to race. They ran and ran as fast as they could. Tim was very fast, but Ron was also fast.
In the end, Tim won the race. But he learned that it was not just about winning. It was about having fun with friends. Tim and Ron became very good friends and raced together every day.
