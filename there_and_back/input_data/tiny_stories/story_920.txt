Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim liked to design things. He made an arrow. The arrow was not good. It was a bad arrow.
One day, Tim and his friend, Sam, went to play with the arrow. They threw it in the air. The arrow went up, up, up. Then, it came down, down, down. It did not go where they thought it would.
The arrow fell on a big cake. The cake was for a party. The cake was now bad. The party was not fun. Everyone was sad because of the bad arrow.
