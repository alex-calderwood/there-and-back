One day, a sleepy dog named Max was lying on the grass. Max was very tired because he played all day. Max had a little friend named Tim. Tim was a flea. Tim lived on Max and they were always together.
Tim liked to play too. One day, Tim decided to speed on Max's back. Tim was very fast. Max did not know that Tim was running on his back. Max felt something tickling him and started to laugh.
Then, Max saw Tim running on his back. Max was surprised! He did not know that Tim could speed so fast. Max and Tim laughed and played together. They had so much fun, and they were not sleepy anymore.
