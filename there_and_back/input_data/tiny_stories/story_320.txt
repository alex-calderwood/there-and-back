Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the pool. One day, they have a visit from Aunt Jen. Aunt Jen brings them a big cake. It is tasty. It has chocolate and cream.
"Can we have some cake, please?" Tom and Sue ask.
"Yes, but first you have to show me how you dive in the pool," Aunt Jen says. "I want to see how brave you are."
Tom and Sue are happy. They love to dive. They run to the pool. Tom goes first. He jumps high and dives with a splash. Aunt Jen claps.
"Good job, Tom!" she says.
Sue goes next. She also jumps high and dives with a splash. But she forgets to close her mouth. She swallows some water. She coughs and spits.
"Are you okay, Sue?" Aunt Jen asks.
Sue nods. She smiles. But she does not feel good. Her tummy hurts.
"Can we have some cake now?" she asks.
"Of course, you can," Aunt Jen says. "You both did very well. Come on, let's go inside."
They go inside. They see the cake. It looks tasty. Tom and Sue want to eat it. But Sue's tummy still hurts. She does not want to eat too much. She remembers the water she swallowed.
"Can I have a small piece, please?" she asks.
"Sure, you can," Aunt Jen says. "But why don't you want a big piece? You love cake."
Sue tells Aunt Jen what happened. Aunt Jen laughs.
"Oh, Sue, you are so funny," she says. "Don't worry, the water won't hurt you. It will go away soon. But you can have a small piece if you want. And Tom can have a big piece. He did not swallow any water."
Tom and Sue eat their cake. It is tasty. They thank Aunt Jen. They hug her. They are happy. They had a good visit. They learned how to dive. And they learned how to be careful.
