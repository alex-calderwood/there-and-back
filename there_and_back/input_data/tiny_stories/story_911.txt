One day, Jim and Sarah decided to join their families on a parade. They were both three years old and were excited to show off their costumes. 
Jim had on a big hat, while Sarah had on a pretty dress. They both had big smiles on their faces as they started walking. 
Suddenly, a cold wind blew and Jim’s hat flew off! He was so embarrassed and wanted to hide. He felt like everyone was looking at him. 
“It’s OK, Jim” said Sarah. She gave him a hug and a smile to show that she wasn’t upset. “We’re still in the parade and that’s what matters”. 
Jim suddenly felt better. He smiled and the parade continued. He was so happy that he had a good friend like Sarah to help him when he felt embarrassed.
