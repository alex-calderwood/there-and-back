Once upon a time, there was a busy little ant named Andy. Andy lived in a tiny house made of bricks. He liked to keep his brick house very clean.
One day, Andy found a big mess in his house. He did not like that at all! He took a cloth to wipe the mess away. He wiped and wiped until his house was clean again.
Andy was happy now. His brick house was clean and he could go back to his busy day. Andy went outside to play with his friends, and they all had a lot of fun. And every day, Andy made sure to wipe his house to keep it clean.
