One sunny day, a restless dog named Max wanted to play. He saw his friend, a cat named Luna, sitting under a tree. Max had an idea. "Let's race to the big red ball!" he said to Luna.
Luna looked at the big red ball far away and agreed. "Okay, let's race!" she said. They both got ready, and then they started running as fast as they could. Max was fast, but Luna was faster. They both had a lot of fun racing to the big red ball.
After the race, Max and Luna were very hot. Max's owner, a kind girl named Emma, saw them and brought a thermometer. She checked if they were too hot. "You both are hot, but you will be okay," Emma said. Max and Luna drank some water and rested under the tree. They were happy they had a fun race and a good friend to play with.
