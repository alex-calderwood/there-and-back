Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a delicate flower in her garden. Lucy loved her flower very much. Every day, she would pick up her watering can and give her flower a drink.
One sunny day, Lucy saw a small bee near her flower. The bee said, "Hello, Lucy! Can I have some of your flower's sweet nectar?" Lucy did not understand what the bee wanted. She asked, "What is nectar?"
The bee explained, "Nectar is a sweet drink inside the flower. I need it to make honey." Lucy thought for a moment and then said, "Okay, you can have some nectar. But please be careful with my delicate flower."
The bee thanked Lucy and gently took some nectar from the flower. Lucy watched the bee fly away and felt happy that she could help her new friend. From that day on, Lucy and the bee became best friends, and they took care of the delicate flower together.
