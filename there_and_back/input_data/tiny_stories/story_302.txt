Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to sing. One day, her mom and dad took her to a big show called an opera. Lucy was so excited.
At the opera, Lucy saw a lady who looked nervous. The lady had to lead the singing. Lucy wanted to help her. So, Lucy walked up to the lady and said, "Don't be nervous. I can sing with you!"
The lady smiled and said, "Thank you, Lucy." They both went on the stage and started to sing. Lucy's mom and dad clapped and cheered. Lucy and the lady were very happy. From that day on, Lucy knew that she wanted to sing in the opera too.
