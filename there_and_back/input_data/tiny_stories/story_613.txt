Once upon a time, there was a pink panda named Poppy. Poppy lived in a big forest with her family. They liked to play and eat bamboo all day long. One day, while playing, Poppy found a magic stick.
Poppy showed the magic stick to her friends. Her friend Timmy said, "Let's see what it can do!" Poppy waved the stick and said, "Reverse!" Suddenly, the trees around them started to walk backwards.
Poppy and her friends were very surprised. They never saw trees walk before. They decided to use the magic stick to make their forest a fun place. They made the flowers dance and the birds sing funny songs.
But soon, the other animals in the forest became scared. They did not like the changes. Poppy's mom said, "Poppy, you need to make things normal again." Poppy knew her mom was right.
Poppy waved the magic stick one more time and said, "Reverse!" Everything went back to normal. The trees stopped walking, the flowers stopped dancing, and the birds sang their usual songs. Poppy and her friends learned that it's okay to have fun, but sometimes it's better to let things be the way they are.
