Once upon a time, there was a little boat. It was an ordinary boat. The boat liked to sail on the water.
One day, the boat met a spark. The spark was small and bright. The spark asked the boat, "Can I sail with you?" The boat said, "Yes, come with me."
They sailed together. But then, something unexpected happened. The spark grew big and bright. The boat was not ordinary anymore. It became a bright and shining boat. They were happy and sailed away.
