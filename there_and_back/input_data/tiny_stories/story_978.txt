Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Daisy. She was always very playful and loved to explore the world around her. Each day, Daisy laid a beautiful rose in the garden as a special surprise for her mom.
One day, Daisy laid a rose in the garden as usual and started to explore the area. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a mischievous squirrel came and snatched away Daisy's rose. Daisy ran after him, but the squirrel was too quick!
Desperately, Daisy asked other animals in the garden for help. A bird remembered seeing the squirrel running away with the rose towards the woods. Daisy went to the woods and called out for the squirrel.
The squirrel eventually came out, carrying Daisy's rose. It looked at Daisy with its playful eyes and put the rose in her arms. Daisy thanked it and promised to keep her roses safe in the garden. From then on, Daisy was extra careful with her roses! The end. 
The moral of the story is that whenever something is important to you, it's wise to take extra care of it.
