There was a boy called Tom and he loved exploring what was around him. One day, he was walking through a big field near his home and he saw something flying in the sky. He stopped and looked up to try to spot what it was. It was an insect! He was so excited and started chasing it, running and jumping around trying to keep up. 
Tom eventually stopped and smiled as he watched the insect display its abilities to soar through the sky. He thought it was really incredible and couldn't help but smile and admire its beauty. He spotted some other insects as well and he became really curious about them. 
Tom's mom was nearby and she saw what he was doing. She said to him, "Tom, why don't we try to find out some more about insects? I think if you know more about them, it might be really helpful!"
Tom was so excited about this idea and couldn't wait to learn more. His mom took him to the library to find some books about insects. Tom was transfixed as he read some of the stories and he learnt so much that day. He began to notice more and more insects in his life and started learning even more about them. Tom was so thankful to be able to learn more about how helpful insects can be.
