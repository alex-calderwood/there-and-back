Once upon a time, there was an adorable cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to play with a box. She would jump in and out of it all day long. She also liked to comfort her friends when they felt sad.
One day, Kitty found a big box in the park. She was very excited and wanted to play with it. She jumped in and out, having lots of fun. But then, Kitty saw her friend, Bunny, crying. Bunny had lost her toy. Kitty wanted to comfort Bunny, so she left the box to hug her friend.
When Kitty came back to the box, she found a big dog inside. The dog growled at Kitty and did not let her play with the box anymore. Kitty felt sad and went home. The bad ending made Kitty learn the moral value that sometimes we have to let go of things we like to help our friends.
