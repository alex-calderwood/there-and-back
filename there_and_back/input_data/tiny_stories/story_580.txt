Jack was driving his car down the road when he saw a big truck in front of him. He honked his horn to try and get the truck to move out of his way but the truck just wouldn't budge. Jack got out of his car and was really mad. He saw the driver of the truck had a gun in his hand.
"What are you doing?" Jack asked.
"I'm sorry," the driver said, in a quiet voice. "I was trying to scare you away so I could drive past."
Jack was glad the driver was sorry but he was still scared. "That's no way to drive," Jack said. "Guns should stay far away from cars."
The driver put the gun away and moved his truck out of the way. Jack got back in his car and drove off, glad that the problem was solved.
