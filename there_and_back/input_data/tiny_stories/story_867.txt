Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in his yard. One sunny day, Tim went outside to play. The weather was perfect for playing outside.
As Tim played, he saw a tiny mosquito flying around. The mosquito said, "Hi Tim! I can't find my way home. Can you help me?" Tim wanted to help, so he said, "Yes, I will help you find your home."
Tim and the mosquito walked and walked until they found a little door in a tree. The mosquito said, "This is my home!" But the door was locked. Tim used his key to unlock the door. The mosquito was very happy and said, "Thank you, Tim, for helping me!"
Tim and the mosquito became good friends and played together every day. And they lived happily ever after.
