Once there was a little bear. He was walking through the woods. He came across a big pot. He went over to take a closer look. Inside the pot there was something scary.
The little bear said, "What is this?"
Suddenly, a voice came from the pot "I am a magic pot and I can grant you one wish."
The little bear was curious. He asked the pot, "What can you offer me?"
The pot said, "I can offer you the most wonderful wish you have ever imagined."
The little bear was excited. He asked the pot for three wishes. The first wish was to be able to fly. The second wish was for him to remain a bear forever. The third wish was for him to protect the forest from any harm.
The pot granted all of the wishes. The little bear was so happy to have all he wished for. He thanked the pot and ran off, content and excited to explore the world with his new magical powers!
