One day, a little boy named Tim went to the store with his mom. They wanted to buy food for dinner. As they walked down the aisles, Tim saw an old man. The old man had a kind face and a soft voice. He said, "Hello, little boy. My name is Mr. Smith."
Tim liked Mr. Smith's voice. He said, "Hi, Mr. Smith. My name is Tim." Tim's mom was happy that Tim was making a new friend. They all talked and laughed together.
Then, something unexpected happened. Mr. Smith's voice changed! It became a big, loud voice! Tim and his mom were surprised. Mr. Smith said, "I'm sorry! My voice does that sometimes. I can't help it." They all laughed and continued shopping. Tim and his mom now had a funny story to share with their family.
