One day, daddy and his little girl went to the park. They saw a big tree and a lot of sand. The girl wanted to play in the sand. Daddy said, "Let's bury something in the sand!"
The girl found a loud toy car. She loved the car because it made a lot of noise. Daddy helped her dig a hole in the sand. They put the car in the hole and covered it up. The girl was happy.
Then, a big dog came. The dog was loud and scary. It ran to the sand and dug up the toy car. The girl cried because her car was gone. Daddy was sad too. They went home without the car. The girl was sad and the day was bad.
