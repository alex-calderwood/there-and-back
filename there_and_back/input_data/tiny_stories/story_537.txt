Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue had a toy box with many old toys. She loved to play with them every day.
One cold day, Sue decided to remove all her old toys from the toy box. She took out a ball, a doll, and a teddy bear. Sue put on her warm hat and coat, and went outside to play with her toys.
Sue threw the ball, hugged the teddy bear, and talked to the doll. She played and played until she was tired. Then, Sue went back inside, put her old toys away, and had a warm drink. She was very happy.
