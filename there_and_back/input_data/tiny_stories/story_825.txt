Timmy was a boy who hated spring. He did not like the flowers, the bees, the sun, or the rain. He only liked winter, when he could play with snow and ice. He was very impatient for winter to come back.
One day, he saw his sister, Lily, making a flower crown with some daisies. He ran to her and snatched the crown from her head. He threw it on the ground and stomped on it.
"Timmy, why did you do that?" Lily cried. "I worked hard to make this crown. It was pretty and it made me happy."
"I don't care," Timmy said. "I hate spring and I hate flowers. They are stupid and boring. I want winter to come back. Winter is better than spring."
Lily ran away, sobbing. Timmy felt proud of himself. He thought he had taught his sister a lesson. He did not care that he had hurt her feelings.
But then, he heard a loud buzzing sound. He turned around and saw a swarm of angry bees. They had seen him destroy their daisies and they wanted revenge. They flew towards him, stinging him all over his face and arms.
Timmy screamed and ran, but the bees followed him. He tried to find his mom or dad, but they were not home. He tried to find Lily, but she was hiding from him. He was alone and in pain.
He wished he had not been so mean to his sister and to the flowers. He wished he had not hated spring so much. He wished he had been more patient and kind. But it was too late. The bees had taught him a lesson. A lesson he would never forget.
The moral of the story is: Do not hate what you do not understand. Be patient and kind to others. Respect nature and its beauty. Or you might regret it.
