Once there was a little girl who loved to watch festivals. She watched so many that it was like she had a special talent for it.
One day, the little girl saw a special festival. It was a friendly festival and it made her smile so much that she couldn't help but clap. She watched it all day long.
At the end of the festival, the little girl made some friends. They were all so friendly and they asked her to come back to the festival again. She couldn't wait!
The little girl watched the same friendly festival each and every year. She watched it so often that it felt like she was part of it. As the years passed, she made more and more friends, until the friendly festival felt like her very own special place.
