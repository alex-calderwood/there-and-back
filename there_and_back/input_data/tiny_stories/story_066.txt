Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. He lived in a deep forest with his mom and dad. Tom liked to surprise his friends with gifts. One day, Tom found a big, pretty stone. He thought it would make a great surprise gift for his best friend, Sue.
Tom hid the stone behind his back and went to find Sue. When he saw her, he said, "Sue, I have a surprise for you!" Sue's face had a big smile. Tom showed her the stone, and Sue loved it. They played with the stone all day, rolling it and making funny shapes in the dirt.
As the sun went down, Tom and Sue were tired but happy. They learned that giving surprises can make others smile and feel good. The deep forest was filled with the joy of their laughter. And from that day on, Tom and Sue always tried to surprise each other with little gifts, spreading smiles and happiness wherever they went.
