Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She was adorable with big eyes and a sweet smile. She loved to play with her toys in the garden.
One day, Lily's toy broke. She felt sad and went to her mom. "Mommy, my toy is broken. Can you fix it?" she asked. Mommy looked at the toy and said, "I can't fix it, but we can replace it with a new one."
Lily and her mom went to the toy store. There were many toys, but Lily saw an adorable teddy bear. "I want this one, mommy!" she said. Mommy bought the teddy bear for Lily.
Back at home, Lily played with her new teddy bear in the garden. She was happy again. The teddy bear replaced her broken toy and became her best friend. They played together every day, and Lily loved her new toy very much.
