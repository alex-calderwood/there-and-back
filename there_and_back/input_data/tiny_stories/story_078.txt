One day, a mom and her daughter walked around their city. The mom pointed to tall buildings and said, "Look at all these skyscrapers. This is our city." The girl was amazed.
The mother showed her daughter the playground. "Let's have fun together," she said. The girl jumped with joy and ran off to the slide. As the mother watched, she saw someone else at the playground. It was a man.
He smiled and said, "Hi. I'm here to support this city. I'm persistent." The mother was pleasantly surprised.
The man explained that he started a project to support the city. He wanted to help make the city even more beautiful. The mother liked the idea and joined his cause.
Soon, mother and daughter began volunteering together. From planting trees to cleaning up litter, they worked together to make their city look amazing. The man was very grateful for their help. He was happy to have such persistent supporters.
