Sam and Mia are playing in the park. They see a big dog with long hair. The dog is brown and white. The dog is friendly. He runs to Sam and Mia and wags his tail.
"Hello, dog!" Sam says. He pets the dog's head. The dog licks Sam's face.
"Hello, dog!" Mia says. She pets the dog's back. The dog licks Mia's hand.
The dog is happy. He likes Sam and Mia. He wants to play with them. He sees a puddle of mud. He jumps into the puddle and splashes mud everywhere.
"Oh no, dog!" Sam says. He is wet and dirty. He laughs.
"Oh no, dog!" Mia says. She is wet and dirty. She laughs too.
The dog comes out of the puddle. He shakes his body and sprays more mud. He runs to Sam and Mia and bows. He wants them to chase him.
"Come on, dog!" Sam says. He runs after the dog.
"Come on, dog!" Mia says. She runs after the dog too.
They have fun in the park. They run and play and laugh.
But not everyone is happy. A man is sitting on a bench. He is reading a book. He is wearing a suit and a hat. He is grumpy. He does not like the noise and the mud. He does not like the dog.
"Hey, you!" the man shouts. He points at the dog. "Get away from me! You are a bad dog! You are making a mess!"
The dog hears the man. He stops playing. He looks at the man. He does not understand. He is not a bad dog. He is a good dog. He is having fun.
The dog barks at the man. He does not like the man. He does not like his voice and his face. He does not like his suit and his hat.
The man gets angry. He stands up and walks to the dog. He tries to grab the dog's collar. He wants to scold the dog.
But the dog is faster. He dodges the man's hand. He jumps on the man and knocks him down. He bites the man's hat and pulls it off. He runs away with the hat.
"Hey, stop!" the man yells. He chases the dog. He is wet and dirty. He is very grumpy.
Sam and Mia see what happens. They are surprised. They are sorry for the man. But they are also proud of the dog. He is brave and smart. He is their friend.
They run to the dog. They hug the dog. They give the dog the hat. The dog drops the hat. He licks Sam and Mia. He wags his tail.
"Good dog!" Sam says. He pets the dog's head.
"Good dog!" Mia says. She pets the dog's back.
The dog is happy. He likes Sam and Mia. He bows to them. He wants to play more.
They have fun in the park. They run and play and laugh. They forget about the man. They forget about the mud. They are happy.
