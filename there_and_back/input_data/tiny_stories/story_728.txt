One day, a boy named Tim and his mom decided to bake a cake. They wanted to make a healthy cake, so they used fruits and nuts. Tim's mom said, "Tim, let's make a yummy cake together!"
They mixed all the ingredients in a big bowl. Tim helped his mom pour the mix into the cake pan. Then, they put the pan in the oven to bake. Tim was excited and said, "I can't wait to eat our cake!"
While the cake baked, Tim and his mom went outside to play. They saw some ash on the ground from a small fire. Tim's mom told him, "Be careful not to touch the ash, it can be dirty."
When they went back inside, they could smell the delicious cake. Tim's mom took the cake out of the oven and they let it cool. Then, they ate the healthy cake together. Tim said, "This is the best cake ever!"
