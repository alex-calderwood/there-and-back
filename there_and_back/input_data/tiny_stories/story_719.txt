Once upon a time, in a charming little house, lived a boy named Tim and his dog, Max. They loved to play together all day long. One day, Tim found a big paper and decided to fold it into a boat.
Tim said, "Max, let's go to the pond and put our boat in the water!" Max wagged his tail and barked with joy. They walked to the pond and put the boat on the water. But suddenly, the wind blew the boat far away from them.
Tim and Max tried to get the boat back, but they couldn't reach it. Tim felt sad and said, "I don't want to lose our boat. What can we do?" Max barked and ran to find a long stick. He gave the stick to Tim, and they used it to pull the boat back.
Tim was happy and said, "Thank you, Max! You saved our boat!" They decided to stay near the edge of the pond, so the boat wouldn't get lost again. They played with the boat until the sun went down, and then they walked back to their charming little house, hand in paw.
