Lucy was so excited to learn about history. Every morning she and her mother sat down to read a story about the past. But one day, Lucy was so focused on the story that she forgot lunch time had already passed. 
"Lucy! You forgot about lunch time!", yelled Lucy's mother.
"I'm so sorry. I was just so interested in the history story", Lucy said sadly.
Lucy's mother smiled and said, "That's okay sweetheart. But don't forget it again, okay?"
That night, Lucy and her mother got cozy in bed and read one more story about history. But then Lucy yawned and fell asleep. Lucy had a miserable dream, where she was forgotten by history. 
When Lucy awoke the next morning, she told her mother all about the dream.
"History will never forget you my love," said her mother. "You will always be remembered."
Lucy smiled and felt much better. She had learned a valuable lesson about never forgetting history.
