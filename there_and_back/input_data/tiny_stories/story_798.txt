Once upon a time, in a big green park, there was a large tree. Under the tree, there was a red basket. In the basket, there were many yummy fruits. A little boy named Tim saw the basket and wanted to eat the fruits.
Tim ran to the basket and said, "Wow, look at all these yummy fruits! I want to eat them all!" He picked up the basket and started to pour the fruits on a big blue mat. He was very happy and excited.
His friend, Sue, came running and saw the fruits too. She said, "Can I eat some fruits with you, Tim?" Tim smiled and said, "Yes, let's eat the fruits together!" Tim and Sue sat on the mat and ate the yummy fruits from the large basket. They laughed and talked while they enjoyed their tasty treat.
