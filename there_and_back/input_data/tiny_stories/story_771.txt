Once upon a time, there was a little fish. The fish was very honest. The fish lived in a big pond. The fish had many friends. They liked to play together. The fish was always happy.
One day, the fish saw something new. It was a big, shiny thing. The fish was curious. It went close to the shiny thing. The shiny thing was a mirror. The fish saw another fish in the mirror. The fish thought it was a new friend.
The fish tried to play with the new friend. But the new friend did the same thing as the fish. The fish was confused. Then, the fish understood. The new friend was just the fish in the mirror. The fish was happy to know the truth. The honest fish swam back to its real friends and told them the story. They all laughed and played together again.
