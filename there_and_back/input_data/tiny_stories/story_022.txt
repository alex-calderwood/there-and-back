One day, a big dog named Max had a plan. He wanted to play in the park with his ball. But when he went outside, there was a lot of fog. Max was frustrated because he could not see his ball in the fog.
Max tried to find his ball, but he bumped into something big and soft. It was not his ball, but a big bear named Ben! Ben was also frustrated because he could not find his way home in the fog.
Max and Ben decided to help each other. They looked for Max's ball and found Ben's home together. After the fog was gone, they found the ball and Ben's home. They were happy and became best friends. The unexpected thing was that the fog helped them find a new friend!
