Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to run and play in the park. One day, his mom mentioned a new game to play. The game was called "Zigzag." Tim was very excited to play this game.
Tim went to the park with his mom to play Zigzag. His mom told him, "Be careful not to get hurt when you play." Tim started to run in a zigzag way, left and right, left and right. He was having so much fun playing the game.
But Tim did not listen to his mom's words about being careful. He ran too fast and fell down. He got hurt and started to cry. His mom came to help him and said, "I told you to be careful." Tim felt sad because he did not listen to his mom. The moral of the story is always to listen to your parents because they want to keep you safe.
