Once upon a time, there lived a nosy mouse. The mouse was always searching. One day, he was searching in an old barn.
Suddenly, the mouse spotted something! He passed it once and then quickly passed it again. It was a yummy piece of cheese!
The mouse was so excited. He scratched and scratched, but the cheese was stuck inside a box.
The mouse squeaked and squeaked, asking a nearby caterpillar for help.
The caterpillar was very nosy. He wanted to take the cheese for himself!
The caterpillar said: "You can pass the cheese to me, and then I will try to find a way to open it for you."
The mouse was so excited to pass the cheese, but it was all a trick. The caterpillar never opened the box, he just took it away.
The mouse was sad. He never got to enjoy his yummy cheese.
