One day, a little girl named Mia was playing outside. The sun was going down and it was almost night time. Mia saw the sky was turning black. She knew it was time to go home.
Mia's mom said, "Mia, it is night time. It is time for bed." Mia did not want to go to bed. She wanted to play more. But she listened to her mom and went to her room.
That night, something funny happened. Mia heard a noise outside her window. She looked out and saw a big, black cat. The cat said, "Hello, Mia! I can talk!" Mia was very surprised. She had never met a talking cat before. They became friends and played all night. In the morning, the cat went back to being a normal cat. Mia knew it was their secret and she could not wait for the next night to play with her new friend again.
