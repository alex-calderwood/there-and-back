Once upon a time, there was a small, cold dog named Spot. Spot was filthy from playing in the mud. He saw a mist come from his mouth when he breathed. He felt a shiver run down his back.
Spot's friend, Tim, a little boy, saw Spot shiver. "You're cold, Spot!" Tim said. "Let's go home and get warm." Spot wagged his tail and followed Tim. They walked through the mist together.
When they got home, Tim gave Spot a warm bath. The filthy mud washed away, and Spot stopped shivering. They both felt happy and warm. Spot knew that Tim would always take care of him.
