Once upon a time, there was a big factory. In the factory, they made toys for kids. Many people worked there to keep the factory clean and make the toys.
One day, a new worker came to the factory. His name was Tom. Tom was nervous because it was his first day. He wanted to do a good job and make friends with the other workers.
Tom worked hard to keep the factory clean and help make the toys. Soon, he was not nervous anymore. He made many friends and they all had fun working together. The kids loved the toys from the factory, and Tom was happy to be a part of it.
