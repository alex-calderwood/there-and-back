One day, two friends named Joe and Paul went to the park to play. They saw a big black swing and ran over to it. 
"Let's share!" said Joe.
Paul smiled and said, "Ok!" 
The two friends each took a seat on the black swing. Joe pushed Paul first to get him going. Paul then reached back and pulled Joe forward to help him get moving. They laughed together as they went higher and higher. 
Soon enough, it was time to go. The two friends got off the swing and hugged. 
"Thanks for sharing!" said Paul.
Joe smiled and said, "My pleasure!"
They then ran off to play other games in the park. It was a wonderful day!
