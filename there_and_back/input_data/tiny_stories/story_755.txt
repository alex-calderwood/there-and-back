Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sarah. She was three years old and loved to have fun.
One day, Sarah found some flour and sugar in the kitchen. She decided to mix them together to make a treat for lunch.
Then, Sarah called out to her mom, "Mom, can I mix these together to make something special?"
Her mom answered, "Sure, but it's almost noon, so you have to hurry."
Sarah quickly mixed the two ingredients together and created a sweet treat. She was so excited to try it.
However, Sarah's mom came in just as Sarah was about to take a bite out of the treat. She saw how spoiled it looked, and yelled, "No! You cannot eat that Sarah. It is too messy and you need to clean up the kitchen now."
Sarah was very sad. She was not allowed to eat the treat that she made. She had to clean up and had no time for lunch. The end.
