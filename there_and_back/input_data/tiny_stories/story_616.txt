One day, Ben and his dog Spot went for a walk in the woods. They liked to see the trees, the birds and the flowers. They followed a trail that led them to a big lake. Spot saw a duck and ran after it. Ben tried to call him back, but Spot did not listen.
Spot chased the duck into the water, but he did not know how to swim. He started to sink and splash. He was scared and wet. Ben saw his dog and he panicked. He wanted to help him, but he did not know how to swim either. He felt helpless and sad.
He shouted for help, but no one heard him. He looked around and saw a big stick on the ground. He picked it up and ran to the edge of the lake. He threw the stick as far as he could into the water. Spot saw the stick and swam towards it. He grabbed it with his mouth and Ben pulled him back to the shore.
Ben hugged his dog and told him he was brave and smart. Spot licked his face and wagged his tail. He was happy and safe. They walked back to the trail and went home. They never chased ducks again.
