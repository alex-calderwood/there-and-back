One day, a big lion saw a small rabbit in the grass. The lion was hungry and wanted to eat the rabbit for meat. He ran after the rabbit and roared, "I will catch you and make you my meat!"
The rabbit was very scared and ran as fast as he could. He saw a hole in the ground and jumped in. The lion could not fit in the hole and was angry. He said, "Come out, you coward! You are not fair! You should let me eat you!"
The rabbit said, "No, you are not fair! You are big and strong and I am small and weak. You have many other animals to eat, but I have only grass and carrots. Why do you want to eat me?"
The lion said, "Because I am the king of the jungle and I can do what I want. You are just a snack for me."
The rabbit said, "That is not a good reason. You should be kind and share with others. You should not scare and hurt those who are smaller than you. That is not how a king should act."
The lion thought about what the rabbit said. He realized that he was being greedy and mean. He said, "You are right, little rabbit. I am sorry for scaring you and trying to eat you. You are brave and smart. You can come out of the hole and I will not harm you."
The rabbit came out of the hole and thanked the lion. The lion said, "You are welcome, little rabbit. From now on, I will be a better king and a better friend. I will not scare or eat you or any other animal who is not fair meat for me."
The rabbit and the lion smiled and went their separate ways. They learned a lesson that day: it is not fair to scare or hurt others who are different from you. It is better to be kind and share with others. That is how you make friends and peace.
