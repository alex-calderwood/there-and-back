Once upon a time, there was a fearful little boy named Tim. He did not like to go outside. One day, his mom said, "Tim, let's go to the park." Tim was scared, but he put on his shoes and went with his mom.
At the park, Tim saw a big dog. The dog wanted to play, but Tim was fearful. He hid behind his mom. His mom said, "Don't be scared, Tim. The dog is nice. Let's play with him."
Tim took a deep breath and walked to the dog. He let the dog sniff his shoe. The dog wagged his tail and Tim felt better. They played together all day. Tim was not fearful anymore. He had fun at the park with his new friend.
