One day, a little girl went outside to play. She saw something shiny in the corner of her garden and ran over to check it out. It was a beautiful necklace. She was so excited she couldn't help but pick it up and put it around her neck.
Suddenly, her daddy yelled out her name. She put her hands behind her back and tried not to look guilty. But it was too late.
Daddy knew she had found the necklace and scolded her for taking something that didn't belong to her. He explained that it was fake and asked her to put it back.
The girl sadly picked the necklace up and put it back in the corner. As soon as she did, it started to vanish! Daddy and the girl stood there with their mouths wide open. 
Daddy told the girl it was magic and then said it was time to go inside. 
The little girl never forgot that day. She always wondered what happened to that necklace and why it vanished like that.
