Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty dress with wild colors that her mom gave her. Lily loved to wear her dress and play outside.
One sunny day, Lily went to the park. She saw a boy named Tim. Tim saw her dress and said, "I like your wild dress!" Lily smiled and said, "Thank you! My mom gave it to me." Tim shrugged and said, "My mom never gives me wild dresses." Lily felt sad for Tim and wanted to help.
The next day, Lily and her mom went to the store. Lily saw a wild shirt and had an idea. She asked her mom, "Can we get this for Tim?" Her mom said yes. They bought the shirt and took it to Tim. Tim was so happy! He put on his wild shirt and played with Lily all day long.
