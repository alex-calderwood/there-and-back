Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big box of original toys. One day, Lily decided to play hide and seek with her toys. She hid her toys all around her room and then tried to find them.
Lily's favorite toy was a long, funny toy called Spaghetti. Spaghetti was very good at hiding. Lily looked under her bed, behind the door, and in her toy box, but she could not find Spaghetti. She started to feel sad.
Then, Lily's mommy came into the room and saw her looking for her toy. Mommy helped Lily find Spaghetti, who was hiding behind the big chair. Lily was very happy to find her toy and gave Spaghetti a big hug. They played hide and seek together for the rest of the day.
