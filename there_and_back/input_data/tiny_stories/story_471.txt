Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a boy named Tom. Tom loved to play with his toys. He was very enthusiastic about his toy hammer. He would use it to fix things around the house.
One day, Tom saw a big ice block outside. He thought it would be fun to play with. So, he took his hammer and tried to break the ice. But the ice was too hard. He tried and tried, but he couldn't break it. Tom felt sad.
Then, Tom had an idea. He asked his mom for help. His mom told him to freeze the ice more, so it would be easier to break. Tom put the ice in the freezer. After some time, the ice became very cold and hard. Tom took his hammer and hit the ice. This time, the ice broke into small pieces. Tom was very happy and continued playing with his toys.
