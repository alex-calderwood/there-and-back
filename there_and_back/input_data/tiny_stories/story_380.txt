Once upon a time, there was a colorful bird. This bird loved to play games. One day, the bird made a fun game for his friends. The game was called "Guess the Color". The bird had a reward for the friend who could win the game.
The bird's friends came to play. They were excited to guess the colors of the rainbow. One by one, they tried to guess the colors. Red, blue, green, and yellow - they guessed them all. They were all very close to winning the reward.
But then, something unexpected happened! The bird showed them a new color that they had never seen before. It was a mix of all the colors they had guessed. The friends were amazed and couldn't guess the new color. The bird laughed and said, "You all did a great job, but I have one more surprise for you." The bird gave each friend a colorful feather with the new color. They all loved their new reward and had a great time playing together.
