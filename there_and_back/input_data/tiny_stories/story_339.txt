Once upon a time, there was a big car. The car had a knob. The knob could make the car go forward and reverse. One day, a bad cat jumped in the car. The cat wanted to play with the knob.
The cat moved the knob and the car went forward. It hit a tree! The cat got scared. The cat did not know what to do. The cat moved the knob again. This time, the car went reverse. It hit a bush! The cat was very sad.
A wise bird saw the cat and the car. The bird said, "You should not play with things you do not know." The cat listened to the bird. The cat decided to stop playing with the knob. The cat learned that playing with things you do not know can be bad.
