Once upon a time, there was a big tree. The tree had a lot of shade. It was a hot day, so many people sat in the shade. They were happy and cool.
One day, a man came to the tree. He wanted to prepare a picnic. He brought an expensive toy for his child. The child was very happy. They played and ate under the tree.
Then, something unexpected happened. A big wind came and blew the expensive toy away. The child was sad. But, a nice dog found the toy and brought it back. The child was happy again. They all played together in the shade.
