Once upon a time, there was a little chair. The chair was very selfish. It did not like to share. It wanted to be the only chair in the room.
One day, a big chair came to the room. The little chair was not happy. It wanted the big chair to go away. The little chair tried to think of a way to solve this problem.
The little chair thought and thought. Then, it had a great idea. It decided to share the room with the big chair. The little chair learned that sharing was not so bad. In the end, the little chair and the big chair became good friends.
