Once upon a time, in a wide river, there was a little red kayak. The kayak liked to float and play with the fish and ducks. Every day, the sun would shine and the water would sparkle.
One day, the little red kayak saw a big frog. The frog said, "Hello, kayak! I wonder what is on the other side of the river." The kayak thought this was a fun idea. So, the frog hopped into the kayak and they went to see.
The kayak and the frog went across the wide river. They saw trees, flowers, and more fish. When they got to the other side, they found a big, green field. They played there all day and had so much fun. Then, they went back to the river and said goodbye. The little red kayak was happy to have a new friend.
