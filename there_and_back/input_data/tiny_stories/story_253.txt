Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man named Tom. He had a big house and many toys. One day, Tom saw a tunnel near his house. He thought it was fun to play in the tunnel.
Tom met a boy named Tim near the tunnel. Tom said, "Hey Tim, let's send our toys through the tunnel!" Tim agreed, and they started to send their toys through the tunnel, one by one.
But, as they were playing, a big wind came and blew all the toys away. Tom and Tim were sad because they lost their toys. The end.
