Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy had a regular toy, a small, red ball. She played with it every day. One day, she saw a big, green ball in her yard. She was very excited and wanted to play with it.
Amy tried to play with the big, green ball, but it was too big for her. She was not patient and got very sad. Her mommy said, "Amy, you need to accept that you can't play with the big ball yet." But Amy did not want to listen. She kept trying to play with the big ball.
One day, while Amy was playing with her small, red ball, she saw a little boy. The boy was patient and played with the big, green ball. Amy was surprised! She asked the boy how he did it. The boy said, "I practiced with my regular ball, and then I was able to play with the big ball." Amy learned to be patient and practiced with her red ball. Soon, she could play with the big, green ball too.
