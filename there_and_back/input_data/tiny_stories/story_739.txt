Once upon a time, there was a graceful bird. This bird loved to bake. One day, the bird found a big melon. The bird wanted to bake a melon cake for her friend, the rabbit.
The bird went to the rabbit's home and said, "Hi, rabbit! I want to bake a melon cake for you." The rabbit was very happy and said, "Thank you, bird! I love melon cake."
The bird and rabbit baked the melon cake together. They had a lot of fun. When the cake was done, they ate it. It was very yummy. They were both happy and full.
