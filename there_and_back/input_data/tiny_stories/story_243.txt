One day, a furry zebra named Zara was walking in the forest. She was looking for food to supply her family. Her tummy was making loud noises because she was hungry too.
Zara met a monkey named Momo. Momo was swinging from the trees. "Hi, Zara!" said Momo. "What are you doing?" Zara said, "I am looking for food to supply my family. We are all hungry." Momo thought for a moment and said, "I can help you find food!"
Together, Zara and Momo looked for food in the forest. They found yummy leaves for Zara and tasty bananas for Momo. They both had big smiles on their faces, happy to find food for their families.
When they were done, Zara and Momo said goodbye. "Thank you for helping me, Momo," said Zara. "You're welcome, Zara. Let's play again soon!" said Momo. Zara went back to her family with a big supply of food. They all ate and were happy.
