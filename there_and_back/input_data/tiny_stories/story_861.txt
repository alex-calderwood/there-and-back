One day, Daisy was walking down a path in the park. Suddenly, she heard a strange noise. It was loud and echoed through the park. Daisy looked around and saw a small bird sitting on a tree branch. It was making the noise. Daisy was very happy.
"All of the other birds belong in the sky," she said. "You belong here on the branch with me!"
The little bird smiled and chirped happily. Daisy and the bird sat quietly together and watched the world around them. But soon, Daisy found it too dull.
"Let's have some fun!" she said. "Let's make some noise!"
The bird chirped again and started flying around Daisy in circles. Daisy laughed and ran around too. They made a lot of noise, but Daisy didn't mind. Daisy and the little bird were soon the best of friends.
