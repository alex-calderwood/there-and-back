One day, a small dog named Tiny was in his yard. He saw a big cat on the other side of the fence. Tiny started to tremble because he was scared of the big cat. The cat said, "I am from another world, and I am here to take all the soft things with me."
Tiny did not want the cat to take all the soft things. He loved his soft bed and his soft toys. He thought of a plan to stop the cat. Tiny said, "I know where to find the softest thing in the world, but you have to promise not to take anything else." The cat agreed.
Tiny took the cat to a big, soft cloud in the sky. The cat was so happy to find the softest thing in the world. He decided to stay on the cloud and not take anything else. Tiny saved all the soft things and was not scared of the big cat anymore.
