Once upon a time, there was a soft cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to play all day. One day, Fluffy went into the office where his owner, Tom, worked.
In the office, Fluffy saw many things. There were papers, pens, and a big chair. Fluffy jumped on the chair and started to spin around. "Wee!" said Fluffy, having so much fun.
Suddenly, Tom came into the office. "Oh no, Fluffy!" he said. "You destroy my papers!" Fluffy looked at the mess on the floor. He felt sad and said, "Sorry, Tom." Tom smiled and said, "It's okay, Fluffy. Let's clean up together." And they did.
