Once upon a time, there was a little boy. He was very worried about packing for his holiday. He had so many things he wanted to take with him, but he couldn't decide what to keep and what to leave behind!
One day, he went for a walk on the beach. He saw an oyster. Inside was a beautiful pearl. He took it home with him. 
He realised he could keep the pearl in his pocket. That way, he wouldn't have to choose what to pack and what to leave behind!
The little boy learned a valuable lesson - it is important to be selective with the things we carry with us in life. We shouldn't let our worries weigh us down.
