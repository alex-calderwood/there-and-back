John and his mommy were in the kitchen. John saw some celery in the fridge.
"Mommy, can I eat this celery?", he asked.
His mommy shook her head. "No, John, celery is disgusting."
John was disappointed. "But why can't I eat it, Mommy?"
"Because it's not dressed," Mommy said. She took some butter and some salt out of the cupboard. She spread the butter on the celery, then sprinkled the salt on top.
John watched eagerly as his mommy finished dressing the celery. Then she handed it to him.
"There you are," she said. "Now you can try the celery."
John took a bite. The butter and salt made it delicious. "Yum!" he said.
