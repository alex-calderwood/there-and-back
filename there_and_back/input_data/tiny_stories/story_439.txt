Once upon a time, there was a rare bunny. The bunny liked to hop around and play with his friends. One day, the bunny saw a cactus. The cactus was big and green.
The bunny wanted to play with the cactus, but he knew it was not safe. The cactus had sharp points. The bunny's friends told him to stay away. They did not want him to get hurt.
The bunny knew he had to surrender his wish to play with the cactus. He decided to play with his friends instead. They all had fun together. The bunny was happy and safe.
