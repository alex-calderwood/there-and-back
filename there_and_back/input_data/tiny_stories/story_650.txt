Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pretty bedroom with lots of toys. Lily loved to play in her bedroom all day. One day, she felt troubled because her favorite toy was lost. She looked everywhere but could not find it.
Lily's mommy saw her sad face and said, "Why don't you kneel down and look under your bed?" Lily did what her mommy said and knelt down. To her surprise, she found a secret door under her bed! She opened the door and saw a magical world full of toys and fun.
Lily was so happy to find the secret world. She played with new friends and had lots of fun. The best part was that she found her lost toy there too! From that day on, whenever Lily felt troubled, she would kneel down, open the secret door, and have a great time in the magical world under her bed.
