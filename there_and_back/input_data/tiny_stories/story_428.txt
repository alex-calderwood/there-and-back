Once upon a time, there was an intelligent dog named Buddy. Buddy was very good at finding things. One day, Buddy found a big bone in the yard. He was so happy! But Buddy had a worry. He did not want anyone to take his bone.
Buddy thought and thought. Then he had an idea! He decided to bury the bone in the ground. He dug a hole with his paws and put the bone inside. Then he covered the hole with dirt. Now, no one could find his bone.
Every day, Buddy would go to the spot where he buried the bone and check on it. He was happy that his worry was gone. Buddy knew that he was an intelligent dog. He had found a way to keep his bone safe, and he could enjoy playing in the yard without any worries.
