Once upon a time, there was a lively fish named Fin. He loved to swim all day in the big blue pond. Fin was always happy and liked to play with his friends.
One day, while Fin was swimming, he saw a big frog named Fred. Fred was trying to squeeze through a small hole in the pond's wall. Fin swam up to Fred and asked, "Why are you trying to squeeze through that hole?" Fred replied, "I want to see what's on the other side."
Fin thought for a moment, then said, "Let's go around the wall and see what's there. It's much easier." So, Fin and Fred swam around the wall together. On the other side, they found a beautiful garden with lots of pretty flowers and plants. They played there all day and had lots of fun.
The moral of the story is that sometimes, we don't need to force ourselves into difficult situations. There is often an easier and better way to reach our goals if we just look for it.
