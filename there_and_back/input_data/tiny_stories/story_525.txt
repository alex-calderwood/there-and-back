Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and run. But Tom was afraid of the big slide. It was very high and dark.
"Come on, Tom, you can do it!" Lily said. She was Tom's big sister and she wanted to encourage him. "It's fun and fast. I'll go with you."
Tom looked at the big slide. He felt scared. He shook his head. "No, Lily, it's too high and dark. I don't want to go."
Lily smiled. She had an idea. She ran to their mom and asked for something. She came back with a pair of pants. They were bright and colorful.
"Look, Tom, these are magic pants!" Lily said. "If you wear them, you will be brave and happy. They will help you slide down the big slide. Do you want to try them?"
Tom was curious. He liked bright and colorful things. He took the pants from Lily and put them on. They were soft and warm.
"Wow, they are magic pants!" Tom said. He felt brave and happy. He followed Lily to the big slide. He held her hand and climbed up the stairs. He looked down and saw the dark tunnel. He was still a little scared, but he remembered the magic pants.
"Ready, Tom?" Lily asked.
"Ready, Lily!" Tom said.
They slid down the big slide together. They felt the wind and the speed. They laughed and cheered. They reached the bottom and hugged each other.
"That was fun!" Tom said.
"See, I told you!" Lily said. "You did it, Tom! You are brave and happy!"
They ran to their mom and showed her the magic pants. She smiled and hugged them.
"I'm proud of you, Tom and Lily!" she said. "You are brave and happy. And you are good at encouraging each other."
