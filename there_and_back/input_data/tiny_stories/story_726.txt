Once upon a time there were two friends, Max and Ben. They were always creating fun things to do together. 
One day they found a magical rub. Max thought it would be a fun idea to try it out. So, he rubbed the magical rub and - poof! - a dragon appeared! 
Max and Ben were sure that the dragon was friendly. But, it grew bigger and bigger, until it became too big for them to control. 
The dragon started to become more and more serious. Max and Ben knew they had to get rid of it, so they tossed the rub in the air and the dragon vanished. 
Max and Ben suddenly felt very sad. They realised they had made a mistake and wished they hadn't rub the magical rub. They both knew they would always regret it. 
The end.
