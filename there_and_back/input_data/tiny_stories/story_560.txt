One day, a little girl named Lucy was feeling very frustrated because she wanted a peach but her mommy wouldn't show her where to find one. She looked around and asked everybody she saw, but nobody seemed to know. 
Finally, Lucy asked her older sister. Her sister knew right away where to find a delicious peach. She showed Lucy to the pantry and pointed out the basket full of peaches. Lucy was so excited that she ran over and grabbed a big, juicy peach. 
Lucy was so happy to have found a peach that she smiled and hugged her sister. Lucy thanked her sister for showing her where to find the peach. She held it tight as she went outside to eat it in the sunshine. It was almost as good as having her mom show her!
