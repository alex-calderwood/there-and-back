Once upon a time, there was a little seed. The seed was in the soil. It was dark and quiet. The seed was waiting to grow.
One day, the seed felt the sun. It was warm and nice. The seed wanted to see the sun. It started to grow. It pushed through the soil. It took a little peek. The seed saw the sun and was happy.
The seed grew into a big, strong plant. It was green and pretty. The plant was grateful for the sun and the soil. The plant danced in the wind and reached for the sky. The plant was happy and loved to grow.
