Ben and Lily were playing in the park with their mom. They liked to slide, swing and run. They saw a big van parked near the gate. It was red and shiny. They wanted to see it closer.
"Mom, can we go to the van?" Ben asked.
"OK, but be careful and don't touch anything," Mom said.
Ben and Lily ran to the van. They looked at the windows, the wheels and the door. They saw a sticker with a picture of a dog. Lily liked dogs.
"Look, a dog!" Lily said.
She reached out to touch the sticker. But the van was very hot from the sun. Lily felt a terrible pain in her hand. She cried out loud.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lily said.
Mom heard Lily and ran to her. She saw her hand was red and sore. She hugged Lily and took her to a bench. She rubbed some ice on her hand to make it feel better.
"I'm sorry, Lily. The van was too hot. You have to be careful with hot things. They can hurt you," Mom said.
Lily nodded and sniffed. She felt a little better. Ben came to her and gave her a hug.
"I'm sorry, too, Lily. I didn't know the van was hot. Do you want to play with me?" Ben said.
Lily smiled and nodded. She still liked dogs, but not hot vans. She and Ben went back to play in the park with Mom. They had fun and forgot about the terrible van.
