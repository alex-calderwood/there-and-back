Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Emma. Emma was very happy because her mom and dad were going to provide a big party for her birthday. She could not wait for the day to come.
On the day of the party, Emma saw many colorful balloons and her friends were there too. There was a big cake with yummy icing and lots of candles. Emma and her friends played fun games and they laughed a lot.
At the end of the party, Emma's mom and dad gave her a big present. It was a toy she always wanted. Emma was so happy and said thank you to her mom and dad. The party was so much fun and everyone had a great time.
