Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia was a very naughty girl. She liked to play tricks on her friends and family. One day, Mia saw her mom hide a big box in the closet. Mia wanted to know what was inside the box. She decided to wait until her mom went out to peek inside.
When Mia's mom went to the store, Mia ran to the closet. She opened the door and saw the big box. Mia was very excited. She opened the box and found a big cake with a smile on it. Mia thought it was for her, so she took a big bite.
When her mom came home, she saw Mia with cake all over her face. Mia's mom was very sad. The cake was for her friend's birthday party. Because Mia was naughty and peeked in the box, there was no cake for the party. The moral of the story is to not be naughty and to always ask before taking something that is not yours.
