Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play in the mud. He would make mud pies and get very dirty. His hands, his face, and even his mouth would be full of mud.
One day, Tim's mom told him to wash his hands and face before dinner. Tim did not want to wash, but he did it anyway. He washed his hands and face, but he forgot to wash his mouth. His mouth was still wide with mud.
At dinner, Tim tried to eat his food, but the mud in his mouth made it taste bad. He could not eat anything, and he felt very sad. Tim's mom saw the mud in his mouth and told him to go wash again. But Tim was too sad to eat, and he went to bed hungry.
