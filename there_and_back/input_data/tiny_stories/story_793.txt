Once upon a time, there was a monkey. This monkey was very kind and caring. People in the town called the monkey "Compassionate Monkey" because he always helped others.
One day, a little girl named Mia was playing near the river. She saw a tiny bird that could not fly. Mia wanted to help the bird, but she did not know how. She called for Compassionate Monkey.
Compassionate Monkey came to Mia and the bird. He picked up the bird very gently and put it in a safe place. The bird was happy and so was Mia. Mia thanked Compassionate Monkey for his help.
From that day on, Mia and Compassionate Monkey became good friends. They played together and helped other animals in the town. Everyone loved them and knew them by their names. And they all lived happily ever after.
