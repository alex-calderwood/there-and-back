Once upon a time, there was a barn in the middle of a green field. There was always a stormy sky above.
One day, a 3 year old child walked up to the barn. The child was a bit scared so it whispered to its mother: "Mom, is the barn scary?".
The mother smiled and said"No, don't worry. You can go close to the barn!".
The child smiled back and carefully opened the door of the barn. Inside there was a big barrel full of water. The barrel was pouring out the water.
The child smiled and laughed. Its mother said: "Look how the barrel is pouring water. It is so cool!".
Yes, the barn was not so scary after all. The child learned that it was safe to explore new things.
