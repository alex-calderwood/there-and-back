Once upon a time, there was an old car. The old car liked to park near a big tree. The big tree was in a fun park with slides and swings. Kids loved to play there.
One day, the old car needed an x-ray. The x-ray would help it feel better. So, the old car went to the car doctor. The car doctor took a picture with the x-ray. The old car was happy.
After the x-ray, the old car went back to the park. It parked near the big tree again. The kids played and laughed. The old car smiled, feeling better now. And they all had a great day at the park.
