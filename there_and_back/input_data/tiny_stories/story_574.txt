One Sunday, a wet bird was sad. It wanted to soar in the sky with its friends. The bird tried to fly, but its wings were too wet. It looked up at the sky and saw the other birds soaring high.
The wet bird tried to shake off the water from its wings. It jumped and flapped its wings, but it still could not soar. The bird's friends called for it to join them in the sky, but the wet bird could not fly.
The wet bird sat on the ground and cried. It was sad that it could not soar with its friends. The sky got dark, and it started to rain again. The wet bird stayed wet and could not soar. It was a bad day for the wet bird.
