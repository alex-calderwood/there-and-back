Once upon a time, there was a big hippo named Hippy. He lived in a small pond with his friends. One day, Hippy was very hungry. He wanted to eat a lot of food. So, he decided to prepare a big meal for all his friends.
Hippy was a little impatient. He did not want to wait for the food to cook. So, he tried to cook everything very fast. Hippy's friends saw him cooking fast and they were scared. They thought the food would not be good.
When the food was ready, Hippy and his friends sat down to eat. They were all very hungry. But, something unexpected happened. The food was very good! Hippy's friends were happy and they all clapped for Hippy. They did not know that Hippy could cook so well. From that day on, Hippy was not impatient anymore. He learned that good things take time.
