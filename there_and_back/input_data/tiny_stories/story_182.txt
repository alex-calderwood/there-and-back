Once upon a time, in a calm sky, there was a pilot named Tim. Tim was a good pilot who loved to fly his big plane. One day, he saw a bird stuck in a tree. The bird was sad and scared.
Tim said, "Don't worry, bird. I will help you." He climbed the tree and very gently, he released the bird. The bird was happy and flew away. Tim felt happy too.
Later, the bird came back with a friend. They thanked Tim for his help. From that day, Tim and the birds became friends. The moral of the story is: always help others when they need it.
