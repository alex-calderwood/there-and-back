Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She was enthusiastic about everything she did. One day, she went for a walk with her dog, Spot. They loved to walk in the park together.
As they walked, Amy saw a shiny chain on the ground. She pointed at it and said, "Look, Spot!" Spot sniffed the chain and wagged his tail. They picked up the chain and continued their walk.
As they walked, a tiny bird flew down and landed on Amy's shoulder. The bird looked at the chain and started to sing. Suddenly, the chain turned into a beautiful necklace! Amy and Spot were very surprised. They took the necklace home and showed it to their friends, who all loved the magical necklace.
