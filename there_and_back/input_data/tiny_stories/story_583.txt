Once upon a time, there was a nosy cat named Tom. Tom liked to go for a jog every day. He would run and jump and play outside.
One day, while Tom was on his jog, he heard a sound. He stopped and listened. The sound came from a little bird up in a tree. The bird was singing a pretty song. Tom wanted to be friends with the bird.
Tom said, "Hello, bird! I like your song. Can we be friends?" The bird listened and said, "Yes, Tom! We can be friends." And from that day on, Tom the nosy cat and the little bird were the best of friends. They played together every day when Tom went for his jog.
