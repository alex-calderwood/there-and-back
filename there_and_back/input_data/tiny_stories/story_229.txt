One day, a driver went for a ride in his big car. It was a peaceful day. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. The driver was very happy.
As the driver drove, he saw a cat. The cat was on the road. The cat did not move. The driver blinked his eyes to make sure he saw the cat. The cat blinked back at him. The driver stopped the car.
The driver got out of the car to help the cat. He picked up the cat and put it in the car. The cat was now safe. The driver and the cat went for a peaceful ride together. They both blinked and smiled at each other.
