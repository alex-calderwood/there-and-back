Sara liked to play in the garden with her doll. She gave her doll a name: Daisy. Daisy had a pretty dress and long hair. Sara and Daisy were best friends.
One day, Sara saw a big dog in the garden. The dog was black and white and had a loud bark. Sara was scared of the dog. She ran to her mom and said, "Mom, there is a big dog in the garden! He is scary!"
Mom looked out the window and saw the dog. She said, "Don't worry, Sara. That is Spot. He is our neighbor's dog. He is friendly. He just wants to play."
Sara was not sure. She said, "But what if he bites Daisy? Daisy is small and soft. She can't run fast."
Mom said, "I will go and talk to Spot. You stay here and watch Daisy. I will be back soon."
Sara nodded and went back to the garden. She held Daisy in her arms and said, "Don't be afraid, Daisy. Mom will make Spot go away. You are safe with me."
But Spot saw Sara and Daisy. He thought Daisy was a toy. He wanted to play with Daisy. He ran to Sara and jumped on her. He tried to grab Daisy with his mouth.
Sara was very scared. She screamed and raised Daisy high in the air. She hoped Spot would not reach Daisy. She said, "No, Spot! No! Daisy is not a toy! Daisy is my friend! Go away, Spot! Go away!"
Mom heard Sara scream. She ran to the garden and saw Spot and Sara. She shouted, "Spot! Bad dog! Leave Sara and Daisy alone!"
Spot heard Mom and stopped. He looked at Mom and wagged his tail. He did not understand why Mom was angry. He just wanted to play.
Mom picked up Sara and Daisy and hugged them. She said, "I'm sorry, Sara. I'm sorry, Daisy. Spot did not mean to hurt you. He is a good dog, but he does not know how to play gently. Are you okay?"
Sara nodded and said, "I'm okay, Mom. But Daisy is not okay. Look, Mom. Look at Daisy."
Mom looked at Daisy and saw that Daisy's dress was torn and her hair was messy. Daisy looked sad and poor. Mom said, "Oh, Daisy. I'm sorry, Daisy. Spot made you look poor. We will fix you, Daisy. We will make you look pretty again."
Sara smiled and said, "Thank you, Mom. Thank you for saving me and Daisy. You are the best mom ever."
Mom smiled and said, "You're welcome, Sara. You're welcome, Daisy. You are the best daughter and friend ever."
