Once upon a time, there was a very organized cat named Tim. Tim liked to keep his toys in a special box. He loved to play with his ball, his toy mouse, and his little bell. Tim was a happy cat, and he liked to share his toys with his friends.
One day, a new cat came to play with Tim. The new cat did not know how to play nice. He took Tim's toys and did not put them back in the box. Tim did not like this. He wanted his toys to be organized. So, Tim insisted that the new cat put the toys back in the box. The new cat listened and put the toys back.
After that, Tim and the new cat became good friends. They played with the toys together. When they were done playing, they would tap the box with their paws to make sure it was closed. Then, they would go outside and play in the sun. Tim was happy that his new friend learned to be organized too.
