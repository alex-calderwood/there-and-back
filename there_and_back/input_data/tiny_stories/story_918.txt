Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Sam. Sam lived in a big tree and had a lot of cobwebs in his home. One day, a crazy bird named Bob came to the tree and saw Sam's cobwebs.
Bob said, "Hi Sam, I like your cobwebs. Can you teach me how to make them?" Sam replied, "Sure, Bob! I can teach you." So Sam taught Bob how to make cobwebs, and they had fun together.
After a while, their friends came to see what they were doing. They saw the beautiful cobwebs and started to applaud. Sam and Bob were very happy. They learned that when you help each other, you can make beautiful things together. And that was the moral of the story: always help your friends, and you can create something amazing.
