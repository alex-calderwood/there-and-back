Once upon a time, there was a corn field. It was very big and tall. One day, the wind started to blow. The corn began to fall. It started to tumble in the wind. It fell over the green grass.
A young rabbit was troubled. It looked all around, but could not find food. Everywhere it looked, the corn was falling. The young rabbit hopped and skipped to catch the falling corn.
The rabbit jumped high in the air. This time it caught a big piece of corn. It hopped around happily, munching on the corn.
The corn kept falling from the sky. The rabbit became less troubled. It could now eat whenever it wanted. From then on, the rabbit was never hungry.
