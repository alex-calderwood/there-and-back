One day, a little girl named Lily wanted to go on a trip. She felt anxious because she had never been away from home. Lily thought about what she needed to pack in her bag. She asked her mom, "What should I pack for my trip?"
Her mom said, "You need clothes, a toothbrush, and your favorite toy." Lily found her green shirt, her green pants, and her green socks. She also packed her toothbrush and her favorite toy, a small teddy bear.
Lily was ready for her trip, but when she got to the car, her big brother Tom said, "No! You can't come with me and my friends." Lily felt sad and didn't know what to do. She went to her mom and told her what Tom said. Her mom talked to Tom, and they all agreed that Lily could go on the trip. Lily felt happy and couldn't wait to go on her adventure with her family.
