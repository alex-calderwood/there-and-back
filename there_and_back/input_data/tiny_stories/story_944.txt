Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there was a little furry bunny. The bunny loved to hop and play all day. One day, the bunny saw a big mountain far away. He wanted to go there and see what was on top.
As the furry bunny hopped closer to the mountain, he met a kind old turtle. The turtle said, "Hello, little bunny! Where are you going?" The bunny replied, "I want to go to the big mountain and see what's on top!" The turtle smiled and said, "I'll come with you!"
The furry bunny and the kind old turtle walked and hopped together to the mountain. When they got there, they found a big rope. The bunny said, "Let's pull the rope and see what happens!" They both pulled the rope as hard as they could. Suddenly, the mountain started to move!
To their surprise, the mountain was not a real mountain. It was a big, friendly giant who had been sleeping under the dirt and grass. The giant said, "Thank you for waking me up! I've been sleeping for a long, long time." The furry bunny, the kind old turtle, and the friendly giant all became good friends and had many fun adventures together.
