One day, a shy cat and a shy dog met in a park. They were both new friends. They played together and had fun. But then, they began to quarrel about who was faster.
"I am faster!" said the cat. "No, I am faster!" said the dog. They decided to have a race to see who was really faster. They got ready to run. The cat was on her knees, and the dog was on his knees too.
Just as they were about to start the race, a big wind came and blew a hat right in front of them. The cat and the dog stopped quarreling and looked at the hat. They both liked the hat and wanted to wear it. So, they stopped the race and decided to share the hat. They took turns wearing the hat and became best friends. The shy cat and the shy dog learned that it was better to share and be friends than to quarrel.
