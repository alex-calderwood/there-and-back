One day, a colorful bird was flying in the sky. The bird saw a big tree and sat on it. The tree had many dry leaves.
A small cat saw the bird and wanted to play. The cat took a step to the tree and said, "Bird, come down and play with me!" The bird looked at the cat and said, "No, I like it up here."
The cat was sad and wanted the bird to come down. The cat thought of a plan. The cat found a ball and threw it up to the bird. The bird saw the ball and wanted to play too.
The bird flew down to the ground and played with the cat. They both had a lot of fun. The cat and the bird became good friends.
