There were two friends, Tom and Jack. Tom had a glove that was perfect. Jack came over to Tom's house one day and wanted to play with the glove. Tom thought it would be alright to let Jack play with the glove. 
Jack took the glove and put it on. He was so excited to play with it and looked so happy. Tom was happy for him. 
But then a few minutes later, Jack didn't give the glove back. Tom asked him to give it back, but Jack just ignored him. Tom was starting to get angry and told Jack to give it back or else. Jack started to lay out his terms and said he would only give it back if Tom gave him a toy in exchange. 
Tom didn't want to give away his toy, but he also wanted his glove back. He had no choice but to hand over his toy and then Jack gave him his glove back. Tom was very sad and felt like he had been tricked. 
The moral of this story is to always recognize when someone isn't being honest. Don't let people take advantage of you; it's important to stay firm and be careful with your possessions.
