Once upon a time, there was a little fox. The fox liked to run fast. He liked to zoom in the forest. He zoomed all day long.
One day, the fox saw a big hill. He wanted to zoom up the hill. But the hill was too steep. The fox tried and tried, but he could not go up. The fox felt frustrated.
The next day, the fox had an idea. He ran very fast and zoomed up the hill. He was so happy. Now, the fox could zoom up and down the hill all day.
