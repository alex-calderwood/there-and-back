Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a cat named Kitty. Kitty liked to spend her evenings sitting by the window. She liked to watch the sun go down and the sky turn dark. It was always very peaceful and quiet.
One evening, Kitty saw a big ball in the yard. She had never seen this ball before. It was round and shiny. Kitty was very curious about this new thing in her yard. She watched it for a while, wondering what it could be.
As the sun went down, the ball started to glow. It was not just a ball, but a magic ball! Kitty was so surprised. The magic ball made the evening even more peaceful and beautiful. The light from the ball made Kitty feel happy and safe. From that day on, Kitty and the magic ball spent every evening together, making the world a little more magical.
