Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Bob. Bob loved to eat radishes. One day, he found a big, hard radish in the garden. It was so hard that he could not bite it.
Bob did not want to forget about the hard radish. So, he asked his friend, the squirrel, for help. The squirrel found a big rock and they used it to break the hard radish into small pieces.
Now, Bob and the squirrel could eat the radish together. They did not forget to share with their friends. All the animals in the garden had a fun time eating the radish. And they all remembered to help each other when they found hard things to eat.
