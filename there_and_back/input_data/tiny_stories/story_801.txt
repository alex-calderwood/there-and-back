Once upon a time, there was a kind King who loved squash. One day, the King started a squash-growing competition and invited all the people in the kingdom to join. All the people wanted to win the competition and prove that they could grow the best squash in the kingdom.
One little girl, named Sarah, was particularly excited to try. She had never grown her own squash before, but she was sure she could do it. She started to clear a patch of land and plant seeds, singing to the squash as she worked.
After a few weeks, Sarah's patch was full of delicious squash. When the King saw how many squash Sarah had grown, he was amazed. He called Sarah to the court to reward her for her efforts.
"Well done, Sarah!" said the King. "Your squash is the best in the kingdom. Here's a special prize for you!" He gave Sarah a beautiful gold crown.
Sarah thanked the King for his kindness. She was so proud of her squash and the reward she had won. She vowed to always be kind and to continue to use her green thumb to make beautiful squash.
