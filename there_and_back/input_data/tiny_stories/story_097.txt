Once upon a time, there was a little goat named Billy. Billy lived on a farm with many other animals. He loved to play and have fun. One day, he saw a new animal come to the farm. The new animal was a big horse named Henry.
Billy wanted to be friends with Henry. He went up to him and said, "Hi, I'm Billy. Welcome to the farm!" Henry smiled and said, "Thank you, Billy. I'm happy to be here." They played together all day and had lots of fun. Billy was very happy that he had a new friend.
One day, Billy saw that Henry was sad. He asked, "Why are you sad, Henry?" Henry said, "I need to pull a big cart, but I don't feel ready." Billy wanted to help. He told Henry, "Don't worry. We can practice together and get ready." They practiced every day until Henry felt strong and ready. In the end, Henry was able to pull the big cart, and he was very thankful for Billy's help. They were the best of friends, and they learned that helping each other made them both feel good and happy.
