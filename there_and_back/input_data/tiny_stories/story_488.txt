One day, a big crocodile was in the water. He was very honest. The sun was hot, and he felt sleepy. He yawned a big yawn.
A little bird saw the crocodile yawn. The bird flew down and said, "Why do you yawn, Mr. Crocodile?" The crocodile said, "I am sleepy, little bird. The sun is hot."
The bird said, "Let's play a game to wake you up!" The crocodile agreed. They played a fun game and laughed. The crocodile was not sleepy anymore. They became good friends.
