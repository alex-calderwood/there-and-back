Once upon a time, there was a big red ambulance. It had a kind and compassionate driver named Tom. Tom loved to help people who were hurt or sick. He would drive the ambulance very fast to make sure they got better.
One sunny day, Tom saw a little girl crying on the side of the road. She was lost and did not know where her mommy was. Tom stopped the ambulance and wanted to help the girl. He asked her what her mommy looked like, but the girl could not say. Tom had an idea. He would display a big picture of her mommy on the side of the ambulance, so everyone could see and help find her.
Tom and the girl drove around the town, showing the picture to everyone they met. People were surprised to see the ambulance with a big picture on it. They all wanted to help the little girl find her mommy. Finally, a lady saw the picture and said, "That's my sister! I know where she is!" The lady took the girl to her mommy, and they were so happy to be together again.
The people in the town learned that it is important to be compassionate and help others when they are in need. They also learned that sometimes, the best way to solve a problem is to do something unexpected. And from that day on, the town became a more caring and loving place for everyone.
