One day, a little girl named Amy went with her mom to the station. It was a warm day, and they were going to see her dad. Amy was very excited.
At the station, Amy saw a big red train. She wanted to touch it, but her mom said, "No, Amy. You must not touch the train. If you do, I will have to punish you."
Amy was sad, but she listened to her mom. Just then, something unexpected happened. A little bird flew down and landed on the train. The bird looked at Amy and said, "Hi, Amy! I can help you touch the train without getting punished."
Amy was surprised but happy. She let the bird help her touch the train, and her mom didn't see. Amy and the bird became good friends, and they had a fun day at the station.
