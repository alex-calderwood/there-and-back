Lily liked to play the violin. She had a small violin that her mom gave her. She liked to make music with it. She played the violin every day in her room.
One day, it was raining outside. Lily wanted to go out and play, but her mom said no. "It is too wet, Lily. You will get sick. Why don't you play the violin instead?" her mom said.
Lily was sad. She did not want to play the violin. She wanted to play in the rain. She looked out the window and saw a big puddle. She wanted to jump in it and splash.
She had an idea. She took her violin and ran outside. She did not listen to her mom. She jumped in the puddle with her violin. She laughed and played the violin in the rain.
But soon, her violin stopped making music. It was wet and broken. Lily was shocked. She did not know what to do. She ran back inside with her wet violin.
Her mom saw her and was angry. "Lily, what did you do? You ruined your violin! How could you be so careless?" her mom said.
Lily started to cry. She was sorry. She did not mean to break her violin. She loved her violin. She did not enjoy playing in the rain anymore. She wished she had listened to her mom.
