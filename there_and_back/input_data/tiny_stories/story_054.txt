Once there was a rabbit, he wanted to win the race, but he was really scared. He was up against some big kids who looked very serious. He hopped to the starting line and he was so nervous. His little heart was racing.
When the race began, he hopped as fast as he could. He was determined to win and he didn't give up. He rushed past the other kids and he kept going faster and faster. He felt like he had wings on his feet.
The other kids saw how fast he was going and started to run too. They were very close behind him, but he was determined to win, so he raced even faster. In the end, he won! He was so happy and proud of himself that he hopped in circles to celebrate his win.
