Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to mail letters to his friends. One day, he found a broken toy in a pit. He wanted to fix it and give it to his friend, Sam.
Tim fixed the broken toy and put it in a box. He went to mail it to Sam. On the way, he saw a sad girl named Lily. She had lost her toy. Tim felt bad for Lily and gave her the toy he fixed.
Lily was very happy and thanked Tim. Sam saw what Tim did and was proud of him. The moral of the story is to be kind and share with others.
