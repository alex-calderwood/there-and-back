Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very hungry. He wanted to find some food. Tim had a map. The map could help him find food.
Tim followed the map. He saw a big tree with lots of fruits. But there was a problem. A big bird was guarding the tree. The bird did not want to share the fruits. Tim was sad.
Then, Tim had an idea. He took out his toy and started to record the bird. The bird got scared and flew away. Tim could now eat the fruits. He shared the fruits with his friends. The moral of the story is to share with others and be kind.
