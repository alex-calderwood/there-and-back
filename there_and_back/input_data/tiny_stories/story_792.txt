Once there was a little boy. He was very patient and he liked to watch insects in his garden. 
One day he spotted a big bug and he decided to reach out and try to catch it. He was gentle and shook it very slowly but the insect wouldn't move. 
The boy shook it a little harder but still nothing happened. He kept shaking it and shaking it until the insect died. The boy felt bad, but it was too late.
The end.
