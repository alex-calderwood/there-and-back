Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lily. She was an original girl who liked to do things her own way. Lily had many friends at school, and they all loved her.
One day, a new pupil named Timmy joined her class. Timmy was very shy and didn't talk to anyone. Lily wanted to be friends with Timmy, so she went to him and said, "Hi, I'm Lily! Do you want to play with me?" Timmy just looked at her and didn't say a word.
That night, Lily went home and prayed. She said, "Please help Timmy feel happy and make friends at school." The next day, Lily tried again to talk to Timmy. This time, he smiled and said, "Hi, Lily. I'd like to play with you." They played together and had lots of fun. Soon, Timmy made more friends, and he was happy at school.
