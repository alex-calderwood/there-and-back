Once upon a time, there was a little spider named Sam. Sam loved to keep his home nice and clean. He was very organized. He always made sure there were no cobwebs in his home.
One day, Sam went for a walk in the woods. He saw a big tree with lots of cobwebs. Sam thought, "I can help clean this tree." So, he started to clean the cobwebs one by one.
Sam worked hard all day. As the sun went down, the tree looked very clean and organized. Sam was happy he could help. He went back to his home, tired but proud. And from that day on, Sam always helped to keep the woods clean and free of cobwebs.
