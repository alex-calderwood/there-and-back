One day, a bright sun was up in the sky. Tim and his mom went to the garage. They wanted to write a big sign. The sign was for Tim's dad. It was his birthday.
"Mom, what should we write?" asked Tim. "Let's write 'Happy Birthday, Dad!'" said his mom. They found big paper and bright colors. Tim and his mom wrote the sign with fun.
When they were done, they heard a noise. It was Dad! He came home early. Tim and his mom hid the sign. They did not want Dad to see it yet. But Dad saw bright colors on them. "What are you doing?" Dad asked. Tim and his mom smiled. They showed him the sign. "Surprise!" they said. Dad was happy and laughed. The birthday surprise was fun for all.
