Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play together. One day, they went to the park with their moms. They saw a big slide and wanted to go on it. But there was a line of other kids waiting for their turn.
"Let's jump the line and go first!" Ben said. He was impatient and did not like to wait.
"No, that's not nice. We have to wait like everyone else," Lily said. She was polite and followed the rules.
But Ben did not listen to Lily. He ran and jumped the line, pushing some kids out of the way. He climbed up the slide and slid down quickly. He laughed and said, "That was fun!"
But the other kids were angry and sad. They shouted, "Hey, that's not fair! You cut the line! You're mean!"
Ben's mom saw what he did and was very disappointed. She scolded him and said, "Ben, that was very rude and selfish of you. You have to apologize to the other kids and wait your turn. You can't just jump the line and hurt others."
Ben felt ashamed and sorry. He said sorry to the other kids and went to the back of the line. He realized that he had made a mistake and that he should be more respectful and patient.
Lily's mom saw what she did and was very proud. She praised her and said, "Lily, that was very kind and respectful of you. You waited your turn and did not jump the line. You are a good friend and a good person."
Lily felt happy and proud. She said thank you to her mom and went to the slide. She slid down slowly and enjoyed the ride. She smiled and said, "That was fun!"
After they played on the slide, Lily and Ben went to get some juice from their moms. They had orange juice and apple juice. They both chose orange juice and drank it. It was delicious and refreshing. They said, "Mmm, this juice is delicious!"
They shared their juice and their stories with each other. They learned that it is better to be nice and fair than to be mean and unfair. They hugged and said, "We are good friends!"
The end.
