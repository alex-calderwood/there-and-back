Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a girl named Amy. She liked to match her clothes. She wore red socks with red shoes and a blue hat with a blue dress. Amy felt happy when her clothes matched.
One day, Amy went to work with her mom. Her mom's work was a big room with many people. They all looked at Amy and said, "Wow, your clothes are impressive!" Amy felt proud that her matching clothes made people smile.
After work, Amy and her mom went to the park. Amy saw a boy with mismatched clothes. She helped him match his clothes too. They played together and had a lot of fun. Amy learned that helping others match their clothes made her happy.
