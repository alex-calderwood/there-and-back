Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He had a spade. Tim liked to move dirt with his spade. It was fun for him. One day, Tim found a tough rock in the dirt. He tried to move it with his spade, but it was too hard.
Tim was sad. He wanted to move the tough rock. He thought and thought. Then, he had an idea. He went to get his friend, Max. Max was big and strong. Tim asked Max to help him move the tough rock.
Max tried to move the rock too. But, the rock started to wiggle! Tim and Max were scared. They did not know rocks could wiggle. Then, the rock moved all by itself! It was not a rock, it was a turtle! The turtle said, "Thank you for helping me. I was stuck in the dirt." Tim and Max were happy they could help the turtle.
