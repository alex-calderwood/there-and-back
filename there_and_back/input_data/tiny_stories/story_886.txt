Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play with their toys and read books. But at night, they have dreams. Sometimes they have good dreams, like flying in the sky or eating ice cream. Sometimes they have bad dreams, like monsters or loud noises.
One night, Ben has a bad dream. He sees a big dog with sharp teeth. The dog chases him and barks. Ben is very scared. He wakes up and cries. Lily hears him and runs to his bed.
"What is wrong, Ben?" Lily asks.
"I had a bad dream. There was a big dog. It wanted to bite me," Ben says.
Lily hugs him and says, "Don't be worried, Ben. It was just a dream. The dog is not real. It can't hurt you."
"But it was so scary. I don't want to have that dream again," Ben says.
Lily thinks for a moment. She remembers something their mom told them. She says, "Mom said that if we have a bad dream, we can think of something good. Something that makes us happy. Then we can have a good dream instead."
"Really?" Ben asks.
"Yes, really. Let's try it. What makes you happy, Ben?" Lily asks.
Ben thinks for a moment. He says, "I like to play with my cars. And I like to go to the park. And I like to be with you, Lily."
Lily smiles and says, "Me too, Ben. Me too. Let's think of those things. And let's say good night to the bad dream. Good night, bad dream. Go away. We don't want you here."
They close their eyes and think of good things. They feel calm and safe. They fall asleep and have good dreams. They dream of playing with their cars and going to the park. And they dream of being with each other. They are happy.
