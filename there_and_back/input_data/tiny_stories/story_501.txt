Once upon a time, a boy named Tim went to the beach with his mom. They had a big, heavy bag with them. In the bag, there were toys and food. They wanted to have a fun day at the beach.
When they got to the beach, Tim said, "Mom, can we unpack the bag now?" His mom said, "Yes, let's unpack the toys and play." They took out the toys and started to build a big sandcastle. They were having lots of fun.
Then, something unexpected happened. A small crab came out of the sand and started to help them build the sandcastle. Tim and his mom were surprised, but they let the crab help. They all worked together and made the biggest sandcastle on the beach. The moral of the story is that when we work together, we can do great things.
