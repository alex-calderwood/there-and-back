Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim was a tough boy who loved to run and play. One day, Tim's mom told him about a big race. "You can win a medal if you are fast," she said.
The day of the race came, and Tim was excited. He put on his shoes and went to the race. There were many kids there, but Tim was not scared. He knew he was tough and fast. When the race started, Tim ran as fast as he could. He passed all the other kids and won the race!
Tim's mom was so proud of him. She gave him a big hug and said, "You did it! You won the medal!" Tim was very happy. He took his medal home and stored it in a special box. Every time he looked at the medal, he remembered how tough and fast he was in the race.
