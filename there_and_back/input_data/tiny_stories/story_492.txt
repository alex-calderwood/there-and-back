Sara and Ben liked to play with their toy band. They had a drum, a guitar, a flute and a bell. They made loud and happy sounds with their band. They liked to pretend they were on a big stage and everyone was clapping for them.
One day, they decided to play with their band outside. They took their toys to the garden and set them on the grass. They saw a big tree with red and yellow leaves. They thought it would be fun to play under the tree.
"Let's go under the tree, Ben!" Sara said. "It will be like our stage!"
"OK, Sara!" Ben said. "But be careful with the bell. It is fragile. It can break if you drop it."
They ran to the tree with their toys. They did not see the cat that was sleeping on a branch. The cat woke up when it heard the loud and happy sounds. It did not like the noise. It wanted to scare the children away.
The cat jumped from the branch and landed on the grass. It ran towards Sara and Ben. It hissed and scratched at them. Sara and Ben were scared. They dropped their toys and ran away. The toys scattered on the grass. The bell fell and broke. It made a sad and quiet sound.
Sara and Ben ran to their mom. They told her what happened. Mom hugged them and said, "I'm sorry, my loves. The cat was mean. It should not have done that. Are you OK?"
"We are OK, Mom," Sara said. "But our band is not OK. The bell is broken. It was fragile."
Mom looked at the broken bell. She said, "I'm sorry, my loves. The bell was fragile. But maybe we can fix it. Or maybe we can get a new one. Or maybe we can play with something else. There are many ways to make music. You can use your voice, or your hands, or your feet. You can still have fun with your band."
Sara and Ben smiled. They said, "Thank you, Mom. You are right. We can still have fun with our band. We can make loud and happy sounds. And we can be careful with our toys. And we can stay away from the cat."
They hugged Mom and went back to the garden. They picked up their toys and moved to a different spot. They played with their band and sang and clapped and stomped. They had fun. They did not see the cat again. The cat was hiding under the tree. It did not like the loud and happy sounds. It wished the children would go away.
