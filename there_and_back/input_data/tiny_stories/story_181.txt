One day, a little boy named Tim was playing with his toy car. He loved to make it zoom across the floor. He would push it fast and say "Zoom! Zoom!" Tim was very impatient and always wanted to play with his car.
One morning, Tim woke up and could not find his car. He looked under his bed, in his toy box, and behind the couch. Tim was sad and knew he needed to find his car to make it zoom again. He asked his mom for help. She said, "Let's look outside."
They went outside and saw a big box. Tim's mom said, "Open it!" Tim opened the box and found a new bike inside! Tim was so happy and forgot about his toy car. He got on the bike and started to ride. He said, "Zoom! Zoom!" just like with his car. Tim learned that sometimes, when you lose something, you might find something even better.
