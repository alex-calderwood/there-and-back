Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lucy. She was a very happy girl. One day, she saw a weird bug in her garden. The bug was big and had many legs. Lucy was not scared of the bug. She wanted to play with it.
Lucy decided to follow the bug. The bug went to a big tree. It went up, up, up the tree. Lucy looked at the tree and thought, "I can climb the tree too!" So, she started to climb the tree. She went up, up, up, just like the bug.
When Lucy got to the top of the tree, she saw the bug again. The bug was dancing on a branch. Lucy laughed and clapped her hands. She danced with the bug on the tree. They had so much fun. After that day, Lucy and the weird bug became best friends.
