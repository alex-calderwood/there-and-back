It was a windy day and Jonas was outside playing. He saw a big, beautiful, colourful balloon blowing across the park. Jonas wanted to reach the balloon and heard his mom calling him. "Get the balloon!" she shouted excitedly.
So Jonas began to chase it. On, and on, and on, he ran until he was too tired to keep running. Eventually he stopped and shouted "I can't reach it!"
His mom just smiled and said, "Come back and I'll help you." Jonas was happy to get help from his mom.
She took his hand, and together they ran until they finally reached the balloon. Jonas was so excited and shouted, "Mom, I did it!"
His mom gave him a big hug and said, "You were very successful. I'm so proud of you!"
