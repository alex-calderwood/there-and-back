Once upon a time, there was a boy named Ben. He was three years old and liked to play. One day, he had an idea. He wanted to play a game with his mom.
Ben said, "Mom, let's play a game!"
Mom said, "Okay, tell me how."
Ben said, "I'll put a squash in my basket and you can catch it."
Mom said, "That's a good idea!"
So, Ben put the squash in his basket and Mom chased it around the room. She was very happy but Ben was very sad. She had caught the squash and it was very harsh.
Mom said, "Why are you sad, Ben?"
Ben said, "I don't like it when you put the squash in the basket too hard."
Mom said, "It's okay, Ben. Next time, I'll try to be gentler."
And from that day on, Ben and Mom played their game but Ben always made sure Mom was gentle with the squash.
