One day, a big, strong dog named Bow saw a little bag of oats. Bow felt guilty because he wanted to eat the oats, but he knew they were not his. He looked around to see if anyone was watching him. He thought he was alone, so he took the bag and ran away.
Bow took the bag to his secret spot under a big tree. He was just about to eat the oats when he heard a small cry. It was a little cat named Dot. Dot was sad because she lost her bag of oats. Bow felt very guilty now. He knew he had to do the right thing.
Bow gave the bag of oats back to Dot. Dot was very happy and thanked Bow. Bow felt good that he did the right thing. They both became friends and shared the oats under the big tree. Bow learned that it is better to share and be kind than to take things that are not his.
