Once upon a time, there was a peaceful city. In this city, there lived a tall man named Tom. Tom was very kind and loved to help people.
One day, Tom saw a little girl named Lily. Lily was trying to reach a pretty red ball that was stuck in a tree. She was too small to get it. Tom walked up to Lily and asked if she needed help.
Tom reached up high and got the red ball for Lily. She was very happy and thanked Tom. They played with the ball together in the peaceful city. From that day on, Tom and Lily became good friends and always helped each other.
