Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Judy. She had brown hair and loved playing outside every day. 
One day, Judy went to the park with her mom. As they were walking, Judy saw something on the ground. She bent down and saw a brown treat. She picked it up and looked at it curiously.
"Mom, what is it?" Judy asked.
Her mom smiled and said, "That's a treat! Would you like to eat it?"
Judy nodded eagerly. She put the treat in her hand and rubbed it with her fingers.
"Ah, it feels so soft!" said Judy. She smiled, then took a bite and ate the treat.
It was delicious! Judy was so happy, she ran around in circles until her mom said it was time to go home.
