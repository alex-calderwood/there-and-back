Once upon a time, there was a shy sailor named Sam. Sam loved to sail on the big blue sea. But he was scared to talk to the other sailors. One day, a big bird came to tease Sam.
"Hi Sam, why are you so shy?" the big bird asked. Sam looked down and did not say a word. The big bird laughed and flew away. Sam felt sad.
The next day, the big bird came back to tease Sam again. But this time, something unexpected happened. The big bird fell into the water and could not fly. Sam was scared, but he knew he had to help the big bird.
"Please, help me," the big bird cried. Sam was brave and saved the big bird. The big bird said, "Thank you, Sam. I am sorry for teasing you." Sam smiled and they became friends.
The moral of the story is, be kind and help others, even if they tease you. You never know when they might need your help.
