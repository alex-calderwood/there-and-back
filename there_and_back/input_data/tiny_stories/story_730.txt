Once upon a time, there was a bald man who loved to explain things. One day, he was explaining to his friend about things that would happen today. He said, “Today, something very bad is going to happen!” His friend was very confused.
So he explained it again, “Today is the day we have to move away from this place.” His friend was even more confused.
“But why?” his friend asked. The bald man shook his head sadly. “Because it is too dangerous for us to stay here.” He said. 
The bald man and his friend packed up their belongings and sadly left the place they had called home. They did not know when they might ever be able to come back. Today was the worst day of their lives.
