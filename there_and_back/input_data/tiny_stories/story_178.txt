One day, a boy named Tim wanted to watch a film. He asked his mom, "Can I watch a film, please?" His mom said, "Yes, but you have to stay in the room and watch an easy film for kids."
Tim started to watch the film. He saw a big, strong dog and a small, weak cat. The dog and the cat did not like each other. They would fight and chase each other. Tim did not like to see them fight. He wanted them to be friends.
Tim talked to the screen, "Dog, cat, please be nice to each other!" The dog and the cat heard Tim. They stopped fighting and started to play together. They became friends. Tim was happy to see them play. He stayed in the room and enjoyed the easy film.
