Once upon a time, in a hidden room, there was a big box. Inside the box, there were many colorful pictures. One day, a little boy found the hidden room and saw the box. He opened it and looked at the pictures. He liked them a lot. 
The little boy showed the pictures to his friend, a little girl. She said, "Wow! These pictures are pretty!" They both looked at the pictures and laughed.
Then, the little boy's mom came into the hidden room. She said, "You found the pictures! They were mine when I was little. I will yield them to you now. You can keep them and play with them."
The little boy and the little girl were very happy. They played with the pictures all day long. And they always remembered the hidden room with the big box of pictures.
