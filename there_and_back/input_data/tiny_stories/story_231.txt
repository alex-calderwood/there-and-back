Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pink dress that she loved very much. Lily liked to wear her pink dress all the time. One day, her mom said, "Lily, it's time to pack your toys. We are going to grandma's house."
Lily was very happy to go to grandma's house. She put her toys in a big bag. She also packed her pink dress. She knew that grandma would like it too. 
When they got to grandma's house, it was a new season. The leaves were falling from the trees. Lily and grandma played with the leaves and had lots of fun. Lily said, "I love this season, grandma!" Grandma smiled and said, "I love it too, Lily." They played in the leaves all day, and Lily was very happy in her pink dress.
