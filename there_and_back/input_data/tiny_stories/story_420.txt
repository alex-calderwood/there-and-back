Once upon a time, there was a boy. He was very brave, and each day he would zoom around his house. One day, he was zoom zoom zooming around, when he heard a voice.
"Hello! Who is that zooming around my house!", said the voice.
The boy looked up, and saw a old man. He was hunched over and dressed in rags.
"I'm sorry sir," said the boy humbly. "I'm just zooming around for fun."
The old man chuckled. "You are brave and humble, my boy. I like that. Tell me, what would you do if you could win one wish?"
The boy thought for a moment. "I would wish for everyone in the world to be happy."
The old man smiled. "That is a wonderful wish," he said. With a wave of his hand, he said, "I grant you your wish!"
Suddenly, the boy felt a warmth, and he knew that his wish had come true. He smiled. From that day forward, he continued to zoom around, happy in the knowledge that his wish had come true.
