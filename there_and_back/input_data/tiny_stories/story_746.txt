Once upon a time, there was a big, old dog named Buddy. Buddy loved to play with his ball. He would run and jump all day long. One day, a small cat came to Buddy's yard. The cat was scared of Buddy because he looked fierce.
Buddy wanted to play with the cat, so he showed the cat his ball. The cat was still scared, but Buddy was kind. He rolled the ball to the cat slowly. The cat saw that Buddy was not fierce at all. The cat played with the ball too. They played together and had lots of fun.
Soon, Buddy and the cat became best friends. They learned that even if someone looks scary, they can still be nice and fun to play with. The moral of the story is to not judge someone by how they look, but to get to know them and see the good inside.
