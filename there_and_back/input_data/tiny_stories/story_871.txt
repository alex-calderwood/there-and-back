Once upon a time, there was a bald man named Mr. Smith. He was a nice man who loved Sundays. Every Sunday, he would go to the park and play with the kids.
One Sunday, Mr. Smith was feeling sick. He stayed in bed and did not go to the park. The kids missed him very much. They wanted to play with him and have fun.
The next Sunday, Mr. Smith was feeling better. He went to the park and saw the kids. They were so happy to see him. They played all day and had a great time. And from that day on, they never missed a Sunday with their bald friend, Mr. Smith.
