It was a jolly summer day and Bobby and his mom were taking a walk. Bobby was excited because he heard his mom telling him that they were going on a camp for the weekend! He quickly began to talk about all the fun things he wanted to do.
As Bobby and his mom were walking, it started to get very cold. His mom looked up into the sky, and said to Bobby with a smile, “Look at that! It looks like it might freeze tonight. It’s getting cold now, but tomorrow will be extra cold. Do you want to wear your winter coat?” 
Bobby smiled, deciding to keep walking in the cool weather. As the day went on, he chattered nonstop with his mom about the weekend camp. But, without warning, the wind began to pick up, and the temperature started to drop. 
By the time they reached the camp, it had frozen overnight. Bobby’s eyes lit up and he couldn’t wait to explore the camp with all the snow. He ran around and threw snowballs at his mom, who couldn’t help but laugh at his jolly spirit. 
They stayed up late, enjoying all the snow had to offer before finally settling in for the night. Bobby was happy to have had such a jolly time even though it was cold and freezing!
