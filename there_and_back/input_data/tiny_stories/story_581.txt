Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was an ordinary boy who liked to play outside. One day, he saw a big slide in the park. He was very happy and wanted to slide down it.
Tim ran to the slide and climbed up the steps. When he got to the top, he saw a patch of soft grass below. He sat down and slid down the slide. He went very fast and landed on the patch of grass. He laughed and clapped his hands.
Tim played on the slide all day long. He slid down the slide again and again until it was time to go home. Tim said goodbye to the slide and the patch of grass. He knew he would come back to play another day.
