One day, a boy and a girl went to the great station. They wanted to see the big train. The boy said, "Let's go near the train!" The girl said, "Yes, let's go!"
At the station, they saw a big, red train. They were very happy. But the boy saw a small, green door. He said, "Look, a door! Let's open it!" The girl said, "No, don't do it!" But the boy did not listen.
When the boy opened the door, a big, loud noise came out. It was a scary noise. The boy and girl were very scared. They ran away from the great station, crying. They did not know that the noise was just a big, friendly dog. The dog wanted to play, but the boy and girl were too scared. They never went back to the great station again.
