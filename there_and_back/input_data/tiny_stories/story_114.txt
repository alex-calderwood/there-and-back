Once upon a time, there was a pretty flower named Bloom. Bloom was a bright red flower who lived in a big garden. She had many friends, like the tall tree and the small bush. Every day, they would play and have fun together.
One day, a new figure came to the garden. It was a spicy pepper plant named Spicy. Spicy was a little bit shy and didn't know how to make friends. Bloom saw Spicy and said, "Hi, I am Bloom. Do you want to play with me?" Spicy was happy and said, "Yes, I would like that!"
Together, Bloom and Spicy played in the garden. They became very good friends. The other plants liked Spicy too. They all played together and had fun every day. The garden was a happy place where everyone was friends.
