Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She liked to play and discover new things. One day, Sally went to her friend Tim's house to play. Tim was a bit careless, but they had fun together.
While playing, Sally and Tim found a door with a big handle. They had never seen it before. "What's behind the door?" Sally asked. "I don't know," Tim said, "Let's open it and see!"
Sally and Tim held the handle and opened the door. They discovered a room full of toys and games. They played all day and had lots of fun. Sally learned that it's good to discover new things, but it's also important not to be careless like Tim.
