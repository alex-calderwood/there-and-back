Once upon a time there was a little boy named Pete. He loved to race his friends, but there was one thing he couldn't do as well as them. This made Pete very sad.
One day, Pete's mom gave him a special violin. She said he could make special music with it. Pete was so excited. He raced up to his room to try to play the violin.
But no matter how hard he tried, Pete couldn't make nice music. The sounds he heard were very sad. He tried and tried but nothing changed.
But then, one day, Pete listened carefully to the music he was playing. Suddenly, he realized that he could make melodies by moving his fingers quickly and slowing them down just right.
Pete was so happy that he could make music. His friends were impressed, and they cheered when they heard the music he made. Pete was so proud of himself and he was no longer sad. He kept practicing and soon he was playing the violin better than anyone else!
