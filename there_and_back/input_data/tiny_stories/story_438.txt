Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a high church. The church had a big bell on top. Every day, the bell would ring and make a loud sound. The people in the town loved the sound of the bell.
One day, a little bird named Timmy came to the high church. Timmy was sad because he lost his way home. He sat on the church's roof and started to cry. The big bell heard Timmy crying and wanted to help.
The big bell rang softly to comfort Timmy. The sound made Timmy feel better. The people in the town heard the bell and came to the church. They saw Timmy and helped him find his way home. Timmy was happy and thanked the big bell and the people. From that day on, Timmy and the big bell became good friends.
