One day, a family had a plan. They wanted to go to the park. They felt lucky because it was a sunny day. Mom, Dad, and their little boy Tom were ready to go. They put on their hats, took a ball, and went to the park.
At the park, Tom saw a big dog. The dog wanted to play with Tom's ball. Tom did not want to share his ball. He said, "No, this is my ball!" The dog was sad and went away.
Mom and Dad talked to Tom. They said, "Tom, you should share. It is nice to share with others." Tom thought about it and felt bad. He found the dog and said, "Let's play together!" The dog was happy, and they all played with the ball. The family had a fun day at the park.
