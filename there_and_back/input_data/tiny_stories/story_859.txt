Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, she found a magic star. The star said, "I can give you one wish." Lily was very happy.
Lily wished for a big, yummy cake. The magic star made a big cake. But, Lily's friend Tom saw the cake and was jealous. He wanted a big cake too. So, he took the cake from Lily when she was not looking. Lily was sad.
The magic star saw how sad Lily was and wanted to help. The star made another cake, but this time it was even bigger and yummier. When Tom saw the new cake, he felt bad for taking the first one. He said sorry to Lily and they shared the big, yummy cake together.
