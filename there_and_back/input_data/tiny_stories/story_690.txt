One sunny day, a boy named Tim went for a walk with his mom. They saw a big fancy house with a lot of toys in the yard. Tim really wanted to play with the toys, so he asked his mom if they could go inside.
"Mom, can we go inside the fancy house and play with the toys?" Tim asked. His mom said, "We need to pay first before we can play with the toys."
They went inside and paid the lady at the door. Then, Tim and his mom joined the other kids and parents in the yard. They played with the toys and had a lot of fun. Tim liked to march like a soldier with the toy drum.
After a while, Tim's mom said, "It's time to go home now, Tim." They said goodbye to the other kids and left the fancy house. Tim was happy that he got to play with the toys and march with the drum.
