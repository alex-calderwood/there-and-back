Once upon a time, there was a whale. His name was Glen. One day, Glen was swimming and he saw a toddler playing in the sea. He swam closer, and spoke to the toddler.
"Hi toddler, what are you playing?" asked Glen, the whale.
The toddler smiled, "I'm playing with my boat!"
Glen was very excited. "Great! Can I play with you?"
The toddler giggled. "Yes, you can play with me!"
So, Glen and the toddler played together in the sea. They both had lots of fun. The toddler felt very safe and fit with Glen by his side. 
Suddenly, the sky grew dark, and heavy rain began to fall. Glen knew it was time to go home, so he said goodbye to the toddler and swam off. The toddler was sad to see Glen go.
The next day, the toddler went back to the same spot and, to his surprise, he found Glen waiting for him. He was so happy to see Glen again.
 
The two of them played together in the sea all day long, and they became very good friends. Every day they would meet up and have wonderful adventures, as if they had known each other forever.
