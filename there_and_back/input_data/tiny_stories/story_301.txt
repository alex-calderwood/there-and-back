Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally loved to choose her clothes every day. One day, she chose a pretty gray dress to wear. She was very happy with her choice.
Sally went to the park with her mommy. They saw a big ice cream truck. Sally's eyes lit up. "Mommy, can I have some ice cream, please?" she asked. Her mommy smiled and said, "Of course, sweetie."
Sally looked at all the yummy ice cream flavors. There were so many to pick from. She chose a yummy chocolate ice cream cone. Her mommy got one too. They sat on a bench and enjoyed their ice cream together. It was a fun day at the park for Sally and her mommy.
