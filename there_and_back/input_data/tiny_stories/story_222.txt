One day, a girl named Sue was in her house. It was raining outside. Sue was sad because she could not play outside. She looked out the window and saw her friend, Tom. Tom was playing with his yellow umbrella in the rain. Sue was envious. She wanted to play too.
Sue's mom saw her looking out the window. "Why are you sad, Sue?" her mom asked. "I want to play in the rain like Tom," Sue said. "But I don't have an umbrella." Sue's mom smiled. "I have a surprise for you," she said. She gave Sue a big box. Inside the box was a red umbrella. Sue was very happy.
Sue and Tom played in the rain with their umbrellas. They splashed in puddles and laughed. After playing, they went inside Sue's house. Sue's mom made them hot pasta to eat. They were warm and full. Sue and Tom learned that sharing makes everyone happy.
