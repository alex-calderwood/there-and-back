Lily and Max were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big hill with many trees. They wanted to climb the hill and see what was on the other side.
"Let's go, Lily!" Max said. "Maybe we can find a treasure or a castle!"
"OK, Max!" Lily said. "But be careful. The hill is very steep and the trees are very thick."
They held hands and started to climb the hill. They had to push through the branches and the leaves. They had to step over the rocks and the roots. They had to yield to the birds and the squirrels that lived in the trees.
They reached the top of the hill and looked around. They saw a big hole in the ground. It was dark and scary. They heard a strange noise coming from the hole.
"What is that, Max?" Lily asked. "Is it a monster or a ghost?"
"I don't know, Lily," Max said. "But I want to find out. Let's go and see!"
They walked slowly to the hole and peered inside. They saw a big pile of bones. They were white and hard and shiny. They looked like a skeleton.
"Wow, Lily!" Max said. "Look at that! It's a skeleton! Maybe it was a dinosaur or a dragon!"
"Wow, Max!" Lily said. "It's great! It's amazing! It's awesome!"
They were so excited that they did not notice the noise getting louder and louder. They did not notice the shadow getting bigger and bigger. They did not notice the teeth getting sharper and sharper.
They turned around and saw a big, furry, angry bear. It was the bear's hole. It was the bear's skeleton. It was the bear's lunch.
"Run, Lily!" Max shouted. "Run!"
They ran as fast as they could. They ran down the hill. They ran through the trees. They ran to the park. They ran to their mom.
They were safe. They were happy. They were brave.
They hugged their mom and told her their story. She listened and smiled and kissed them.
"That was a very adventurous story, Lily and Max," she said. "But next time, please stay away from the bear's hole. It's not a good place to play."
"OK, mom," Lily and Max said. "We will. We love you."
They love their mom. They love each other. They love to play. They love to tell stories.
