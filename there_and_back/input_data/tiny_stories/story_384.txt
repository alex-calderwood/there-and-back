Once upon a time there were two little friends, Amy and Jake. They were best friends and played together all the time.
One day, Amy gave Jake a special present. It was a plant and she loved it very much. But when Jake opened it, the plant split in two! Jake was embarrassed because he had made Amy's present break.
Amy said, "It's okay Jake, I still love you!" Jake was so happy to hear this.
The two friends learnt a lesson that day. They realised that when things don't go as planned, Friendship and Love can make it alright!
