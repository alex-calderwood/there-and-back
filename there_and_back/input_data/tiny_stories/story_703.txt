One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the park. She saw her best friend, Tom, hiding behind a tree. Lucy was an honest girl and knew that Tom was playing a game. She walked up to him and asked, "What are you doing, Tom?"
Tom smiled and said, "I have a surprise! Close your eyes." Lucy closed her eyes and waited. Tom took his thumb and gently tapped her nose. "Now, open your eyes!" he said. Lucy opened her eyes to see a big, red balloon. Tom had revealed the surprise to her.
Lucy was so happy and thanked Tom for the balloon. They played all day in the park, holding the balloon and laughing. As the sun went down, they knew it was time to go home. Lucy and Tom said goodbye, but they knew they would see each other again soon for more fun and games.
