One day, a warm wind blew in the sky. It was a nice day. A little girl named Lily went to the park to play. She saw a big tree with a sign on it. The sign had a picture of a kite. Lily wanted to fly a kite too.
Lily ran home and told her mom, "I want to fly a kite in the park!" Her mom said, "Okay, let's make a kite together." They made a pretty kite with colors red, blue, and yellow. Lily was very happy.
The next day, Lily and her mom went to the park. The warm wind was still blowing. Lily ran with her kite and it went up in the sky. She looked at the sign on the tree and smiled. The sign had helped her find a fun thing to do on a warm, windy day.
