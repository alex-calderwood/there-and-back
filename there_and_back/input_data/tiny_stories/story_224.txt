Once upon a time, there was a tiger named Tom. Tom lived in a deep, dark forest. He liked to play with his friends.
One day, Tom saw a big box. He went inside the box and said, "I will disappear now!" And just like that, Tom disappeared. His friends looked for him, but they could not find him.
Tom's friend, a little bird, asked, "Where did Tom go?" The other animals said, "We don't know. He disappeared."
Tom's friends looked and looked, but they could not find him. They were very sad. Tom did not come back, and his friends missed him a lot.
