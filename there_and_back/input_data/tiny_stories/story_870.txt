Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play together at school. One day, they want to go to the park after school. They ask their moms if they can go.
"Yes, you can go, but you have to take the bus," Sue's mom says. "The bus is reliable. It comes every ten minutes. You have to wait at the bus stop and pay the driver. Do you understand?"
"Yes, mom, we understand," Sue says.
Tom and Sue walk to the bus stop. They see many cars and people on the street. They hold hands and wait for the bus. They see a big yellow bus coming. It has a sign that says "Park".
"Look, Tom, that's our bus!" Sue says.
They wave at the bus. The bus stops and opens the door. Tom and Sue climb on the bus. They pay the driver and find a seat. The bus starts to move.
"Wow, this is fun!" Tom says. "We are on the bus!"
The bus goes fast and slow. It stops and goes. It turns left and right. It passes many buildings and trees. Tom and Sue look out the window and see many things.
"Look, Sue, there's a dog!" Tom says.
"Look, Tom, there's a bird!" Sue says.
They laugh and talk. They are happy. They become friends with the bus driver. He tells them stories and jokes. He is nice and funny.
Soon, they see the park. It has a big playground and a pond. It has swings and slides and a sandbox. It has ducks and geese and fish.
"Here we are, kids," the bus driver says. "This is the park. Have fun and be careful. I'll be back in an hour to pick you up."
"Thank you, bus driver!" Tom and Sue say.
They get off the bus. They run to the playground. They play and have fun. They are glad they took the bus. The bus is reliable. It takes them to the park and back. They love the bus.
