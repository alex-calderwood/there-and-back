Once upon a time, there was a fragile egg. The egg was purple. It lived on a farm with other eggs.
One day, the egg started to complain. It was not happy. The egg said, "I want to be with the other eggs!" The farmer heard the egg and took it to the other eggs.
The fragile purple egg was happy for a little while. But then, the other eggs started to play. They played too rough. The purple egg was too fragile. It broke and the egg was gone. The end.
