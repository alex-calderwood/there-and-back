One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park. In the park, she saw a small caterpillar. Lily wanted to examine the caterpillar. She looked at it very close and said "Hi, little caterpillar!"
The caterpillar looked at Lily and said, "I am very sad. I ate a bitter leaf, and now my tummy hurts." Lily wanted to help the caterpillar feel better. She thought about what could make the caterpillar happy.
Lily had an idea! She gave the caterpillar a sweet leaf from a nearby tree. The caterpillar ate the sweet leaf and began to feel better. But then, something unexpected happened. The caterpillar started to change!
The caterpillar became a big, beautiful butterfly. Lily was so surprised! The butterfly said, "Thank you, Lily, for helping me. Now I can fly and be happy!" Lily and the butterfly played in the park all day, and they became the best of friends.
