Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside in the dirt. One day, Tim found a big bag of powder. The powder was white and soft.
Tim thought it would be fun to play with the powder. He poured it on the ground and jumped in it. Tim got very filthy. His clothes and face were covered in the white powder.
Tim's mom saw him and yelled, "Tim, what are you doing?" Tim looked at his mom and said, "I found powder and played in it." His mom laughed and said, "You are so filthy! Let's go inside and get you clean." Tim and his mom went inside, and she helped him wash off all the powder.
