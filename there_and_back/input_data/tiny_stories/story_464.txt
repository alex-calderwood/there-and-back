Ben and Lily liked to play in the backyard. They had a big sandbox, a swing, and a slide. They also liked to look at the birds, the flowers, and the bugs. Sometimes, they found interesting things in the grass, like a shiny rock, a feather, or a worm.
One day, they saw something new on the clothesline. It was a big, colorful blanket. It had many shapes and patterns on it. Ben and Lily thought it was very pretty. They wanted to touch it and see what it felt like.
They ran to the clothesline and reached for the blanket. But it was too high for them. They jumped and stretched, but they could not grab it. They felt sad and frustrated. They hoped they could find a way to get the blanket.
They looked around and saw a stool in the corner. It was where Mom put the laundry basket when she hung the clothes. They had an idea. They dragged the stool to the clothesline and climbed on it. Now they were taller. They reached for the blanket again.
This time, they could touch it. It was soft and warm. They smiled and pulled it down. They wrapped themselves in it and felt cozy and happy. They played with the blanket, making a tent, a cape, and a bed. They had a lot of fun.
Mom came out and saw them. She was not angry. She was glad they liked the blanket. She told them it was a special blanket that Grandma made for them. She said Grandma hoped they would enjoy it and remember her. Ben and Lily hugged the blanket and said thank you. They loved Grandma and the blanket. They thought it was the most interesting thing in the backyard.
