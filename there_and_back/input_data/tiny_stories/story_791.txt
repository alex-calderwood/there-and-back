Once upon a time, there was a loyal dog named Spot. Spot loved to play outside with his best friend, a little boy named Tim. One sunny day, they went to the park to play.
As they played, they saw a big cloud in the sky. The cloud was fluffy and white. Tim and Spot loved to watch the clouds as they ran and played in the park.
While they were playing, Spot began to chase a butterfly. He was so excited that he did not see a big rock in his way. Spot stumbled on the rock and fell down. He was hurt and cried out in pain.
Tim ran to Spot and tried to help him. He was very sad to see his loyal friend hurt. They went home, but Spot could not play anymore. From that day on, Spot could not run and play with Tim like before. They were both very sad that their fun days in the park were over.
