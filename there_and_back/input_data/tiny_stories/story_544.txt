One day, a little boy named Tim was playing outside. He was running and jumping, but then he fell down. He felt pain in his arm and started to cry. His friend, Lisa, saw what happened and came over to help.
"Tim, are you okay?" Lisa asked. Tim said, "My arm hurts." Lisa wanted to help Tim, so she offered to take him to his mom. They walked to Tim's house together.
When they got there, Tim's mom saw that he was hurt and restless. She gave him a hug and said, "I will make the pain go away." She put a bandage on Tim's arm and gave him a kiss. Tim felt better and said, "Thank you, Mom and Lisa." They all smiled and went back outside to play.
