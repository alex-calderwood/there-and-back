Once upon a time there was a family of three living in a house. Mom and Dad were very happy but the little girl, who was three years old, was not. She wanted to do something special but Mom and Dad said it wasn't important. 
One day, the little girl was so frustrated she decided to run away from home. She was out in the garden when her mom spotted her.
"Where are you going?" Mom said.
"To jump in the sky," said the little girl.
Mom was concerned and said, "Sweetheart, you can't jump in the sky. It's important for you to stay here with us."
The little girl was still determined to leave, so she said, "I'll stay if you make me a salad."
Mom and Dad sensed that this was important to the little girl, so they agreed. Mom made her a delicious salad and the little girl was happy. They agreed that she would stay at home and listen to Mom and Dad instead of running away. 
The little girl learned a valuable lesson that day - that what her parents said was important.
