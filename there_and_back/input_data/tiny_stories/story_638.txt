Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily lived in a small house with her mom and dad. One day, Lily found a hidden toy under her bed. She was so happy to play with it. She noticed that the toy was cold, so she wrapped it in a warm blanket. The toy felt better and thanked Lily.
Lily's mom saw her taking care of the toy and smiled. She told Lily that it was good to care for others, even if they were toys. Lily felt proud and happy. She wanted to help more.
One day, Lily saw a little bird outside her window. The bird was shivering in the cold. Lily remembered how she had helped the toy, so she took a blanket and went outside. She wrapped the bird in the blanket and soon, the bird felt warm and happy. The bird thanked Lily and flew away.
Lily learned that it was important to be kind and help others, no matter how small they were. She promised to always help those in need and be a good friend to everyone.
