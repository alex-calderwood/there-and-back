Once upon a time, there were two friends, Bobby and Lucy. Bobby always had lots of fun ideas, so he was very creative.
One day, Bobby said to Lucy, "Let's go to the veterinarian! I heard they are really cool!" 
Lucy was intrigued by Bobby's idea and asked "Why do we need to go to the veterinarian?" 
Bobby replied, "I heard that veterinarians can help us count animals. We can number them, so then we know how many there are!" 
So, Bobby and Lucy went to the veterinarian. She was so nice and helpful, and she showed them lots of animals. Bobby and Lucy loved counting the animals! It was so much fun.
At the end of their visit, Bobby and Lucy thanked the veterinarian. They said, "We had the best time! Thank you for helping us number all the animals." 
The veterinarian smiled and said "You two are very creative! I'm glad you had a good time." 
And Bobby and Lucy went home happy.
