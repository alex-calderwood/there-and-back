Once upon a time, there was a little blue bird named Bob. Bob loved to fly high in the sky. One day, he decided to go on a journey. He wanted to see new things and make new friends.
Bob started his journey in the morning. As he flew, he passed by many trees and houses. He saw children playing and dogs running. He even passed by a big, blue lake. The lake was so pretty, and it made Bob very happy.
At the end of his journey, Bob found a lovely park. He saw other birds and animals playing there. He made many new friends and had lots of fun. When the sun went down, Bob flew back home, excited to tell his family about his amazing journey.
