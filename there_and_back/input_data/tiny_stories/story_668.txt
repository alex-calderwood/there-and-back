Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to sleep in her big, soft bed. Every night, she would put on her cozy pajamas and snuggle under her warm blanket.
One hot day, Lily's mommy told her that she had a surprise present for her. Lily was very excited and couldn't wait to see what it was. She jumped up and down and clapped her hands with joy.
Mommy brought out a big box with a pretty bow on it. Lily opened the present and found a cute, new fan inside. She was so happy! Now, even on hot nights, Lily could sleep in her bed with the cool breeze from her fan. And they all lived happily ever after.
