One day, a girl named Sue went for a walk. The sky was dark, but Sue was not scared. She took a step and saw a big tree. Under the tree, there was a cat. The cat seemed sad.
"Hi, cat," Sue said. "Why are you sad?" The cat looked at Sue and said, "I lost my toy. Can you help me find it?" Sue nodded and they went to look for the toy together.
They took many steps and found a box. Sue opened the box and, surprise! Inside was the cat's toy and many more toys! The cat was happy and said, "Thank you, Sue!" They played with the toys until the sky was not dark anymore.
