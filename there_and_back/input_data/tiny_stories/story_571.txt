Once upon a time, there was a big cook. He made yummy food. One day, he made a big cake. He was very happy. But he did not know a thief was near.
The thief was scared. He wanted the big cake. He waited for the cook to go away. Then, he took the big cake and ran away very fast.
The cook came back and saw the big cake was gone. He was very sad. He looked and looked, but he could not find the cake. The thief ate the cake, and the cook was sad forever.
