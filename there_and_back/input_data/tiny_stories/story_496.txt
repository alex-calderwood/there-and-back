One day, a sweet little girl named Lily went to the park with her mom. Lily loved to play in the park and see all the pretty things. Her mom had a camera to take pictures of Lily having fun.
Lily saw a nice boy named Tim. Tim had a toy that could display pretty colors. Lily said, "Wow, that's so cool! Can I see?" Tim said, "Sure, look at this!" He pushed a button, and the toy showed many colors. Lily clapped her hands and smiled.
Lily's mom took a picture with her camera. The picture showed Lily and Tim playing with the toy. When they went home, Lily's mom put the picture on the wall. Now, Lily could always remember her fun day at the park with her new friend and the colorful toy.
