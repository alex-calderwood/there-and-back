One day, a fancy cat named Tom went for a walk. He saw a big tree with red fruit. Tom thought the fruit looked good to eat. But, he did not know that the fruit was starting to rot.
Tom met his friend, a dog named Sam. Sam said, "Tom, do not eat that fruit! It is not good. Let's play a quiz game instead." Tom liked quiz games, so he agreed to play with Sam.
They played the quiz game and had lots of fun. After playing, Tom was happy he did not eat the rotting fruit. He thanked Sam for stopping him. From that day on, Tom knew to always listen to his friends.
