Once upon a time, there was a friendly cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with a big garden. In the garden, there were many herbs. Tom liked to smell the herbs every day.
One day, Tom made a plan to plant more herbs in the garden. He wanted to share the nice smells with his friends. He asked his friends, a dog and a bird, to help him with his plan.
The dog dug holes, the bird dropped seeds, and Tom covered the seeds with dirt. They worked together and planted many herbs. Soon, the garden was full of nice smells. Tom and his friends were very happy with their plan.
