Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a toy model car. He loved his car very much. But there was a girl named Sue who lived next door. Sue was not patient. She would always take Tim's car and play with it. Tim would say, "Sue, please give me back my car!" But Sue would not listen.
One day, Sue took the car again. Tim was very sad. He thought Sue must hate him. But then, something unexpected happened. Sue came back with the car. She had painted it with pretty colors. She said, "Tim, I'm sorry for taking your car. I wanted to make it look nice for you."
Tim was very happy. He did not think Sue hated him anymore. They played with the model car together, and they became good friends. From that day on, Sue learned to be more patient, and they shared their toys with each other.
