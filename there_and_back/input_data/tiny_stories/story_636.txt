Tim and Sam are brothers. They like to sell strawberries at the market. They pick the strawberries from their garden. They put them in a basket. They walk to the market.
At the market, they see many people. They see a man with a big hat. He comes to their basket. He says, "Hello, boys. How much are your strawberries?"
Tim says, "One coin for one strawberry. They are very good and sweet."
The man with the big hat says, "That is too much. I will give you one coin for two strawberries."
Sam says, "No, that is not fair. We worked hard to pick them. They are worth one coin each."
The man with the big hat says, "Fine. I will take them anyway." He grabs the basket and runs away.
Tim and Sam are very sad and angry. They chase the man with the big hat. They shout, "Stop! Give us back our strawberries!"
But the man with the big hat is too fast. He disappears in the crowd. Tim and Sam cannot find him. They have no strawberries and no coins. They go home crying. They have a bad day.
