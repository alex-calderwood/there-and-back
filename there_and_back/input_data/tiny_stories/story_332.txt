Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. One day, Spot went to the park to play. The sun was bright and the grass was wet from the rain.
Spot saw a big tree and decided to peek behind it. He found a small box. Inside the box was a lunch! There were yummy treats like a sandwich, an apple, and a cookie.
Spot ate the lunch and was very happy. After eating, he played in the wet grass with his friends. They all had a fun day at the park.
