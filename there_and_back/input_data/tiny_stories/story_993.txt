Once upon a time, there was a little ant named Tim. Tim was a slow ant, but he was very happy. He loved to find food for his family. One day, he went to look for food and found a big, green mint leaf.
Tim wanted to take the mint leaf back to his family, but it was too big for him. He tried to lay on the leaf and push it, but it did not move. Tim felt sad and didn't know what to do. He needed help to move the big mint leaf.
Then, Tim met a strong beetle named Ben. Tim asked Ben for help, and Ben said yes. Together, they pushed the mint leaf back to Tim's family. Tim's family was so happy to have the mint leaf. Tim learned that even slow ants can do big things with a little help from friends.
