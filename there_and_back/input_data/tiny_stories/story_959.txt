One day, three year old Tommy was playing in his room when he noticed something incredible on his desk. On the desk there was a huge pile of presents. Tommy got so excited that he ran to his Mom and shouted, "Mom! Look! Presents!"
His Mom was equally as excited and said, "Tommy, someone must have spoiled you!"
Tommy didn't understand but asked his Mom, "What does spoil mean?"
His Mom smiled and answered, "It means that someone was very kind to you and gave you lots of presents!"
Tommy said, "Wow!" and went back to his room to open the incredible presents he had received. He was so happy.
