Tom and Lily wanted to build a house for their toys. They had some wood, a hammer and some nails. They asked their dad to help them.
"Be careful with the hammer and the nails," dad said. "They can hurt you if you are not wise."
Tom and Lily nodded. They tried to be wise. They took turns to hold the wood and hit the nails. They made a wall, then another wall, then a roof.
"Look, dad, we made a house!" Tom said.
"Wow, you did a great job!" dad said. "But you forgot something. What does a house need?"
"A door!" Lily said.
"Yes, a door. How can you make a door?" dad asked.
Tom and Lily thought hard. They looked at the wood and the nails. They had an idea.
"We can cut a hole in the wall with a saw," Tom said.
"And we can use a hinge to make the door move," Lily said.
"Good thinking!" dad said. "But you need my help to use the saw and the hinge. They are not for little kids."
"OK, dad, can you help us?" Tom and Lily asked.
"Of course, I can help you," dad said. "Let's finish the house together."
Tom and Lily smiled. They were happy to have a wise dad who could help them. They worked with dad to make a door for their house. Then they put their toys inside and played with them. They had a lot of fun.
