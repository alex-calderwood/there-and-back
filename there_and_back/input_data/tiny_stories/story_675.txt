One day, a boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a man who wanted to sell a ball. The ball was big and red, but it was also filthy. Tim wanted to make the ball clean.
Tim took the ball home and washed it with water and soap. Now the ball was clean and shiny. Tim was very happy with his new ball. He went back to the park to play.
At the park, Tim saw his friend, Sam. They played a game of jog and catch with the clean red ball. They ran and laughed all day. Tim was glad he bought the filthy ball and made it clean.
