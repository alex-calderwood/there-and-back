One day, a little girl named Amy found some paint. She was very happy. Amy wanted to make a pretty picture with the paint. She took her paint and brush and went outside to paint.
Amy started to paint a big sun and some flowers. She was having so much fun. She painted a big tree and a little house too. The colors were so bright and pretty. Amy felt like a real artist.
But then, Amy dropped her paint on the ground. The paint went everywhere! It looked crazy. Amy was sad, and she didn't know what to do. But then, her mom came outside and saw the crazy paint. She laughed and said it was beautiful. Amy smiled and started to paint again, making more crazy, pretty pictures.
