Mandy was a three year old who loved looking at jewelry. She often asked her mom to show her different pieces in her jewelry box.
One day her mom said, "I have something special. Come here and I'll show it to you."
Mandy was excited and ran over. Her mom opened the jewelry box and took out a beautiful necklace with a big gem.
Mandy said, "Oh, that's so pretty!" 
But then a rude voice said, "Give it to me!"
Mandy turned around and saw an old man standing there. He looked very mean and didn't even say please.
Mandy's mom told him, "No, this necklace is mine and I'm not giving it to you."
So the old man left and Mandy could admire her mom's beautiful jewelry once again.
