One day, Mommy and Daddy decided to go to the ranch. They had never been to one before and were very excited.
When they got there, they saw a really big horse. Daddy said, “That must be the ranch horse!” They went up to it and it felt very soft.
Mommy said, “Let’s go and explore the rest of the ranch!” So they went and saw lots of things. They saw cows, chickens and even a duck pond. They also saw a big field of flowers. They decided to take a picture as a reminder of their fun day.
At the end of the day, they said goodbye to the ranch and headed home. They had a really fun day and would never forget it!
