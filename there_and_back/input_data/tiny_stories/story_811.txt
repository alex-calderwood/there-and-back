One day, a little girl named Mia went to the park with her mom. Mia had her sunglasses on because it was very sunny outside. She also had a big box of toys with her to play with. Mia was very happy.
Mia wanted to sort her toys into two piles: one for the big toys and one for the small toys. While she was sorting her toys, a little boy named Tim came over. Tim was wearing terrible sunglasses that were too big for his face. They both laughed at Tim's funny sunglasses.
As they were playing, a big gust of wind came and blew Tim's terrible sunglasses away. Mia had an idea. She took her sunglasses off and gave them to Tim. Now they both had good sunglasses to wear. They played together all day and became best friends. The unexpected wind made them laugh and brought them closer.
