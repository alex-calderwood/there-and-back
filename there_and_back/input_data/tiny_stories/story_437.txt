Once upon a time, there was a farm. On the farm, there was a pig and a cow. The pig and the cow were good friends. They liked to play and have fun on the farm.
One day, the pig found a tight hat. The pig put the hat on his head. "Look at me, cow! I use a hat!" said the pig. The cow laughed and said, "You look funny, pig!"
Then, something unexpected happened. A big wind came and blew the hat off the pig's head. The hat flew high in the sky. The pig and the cow were sad. They wanted the hat back. But then, a bird caught the hat and brought it back to the pig. The pig and the cow were happy again. They thanked the bird and played together on the farm.
