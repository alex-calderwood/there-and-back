Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her dolls and dress them up in amazing fashion. She would pull their clothes on and off to make them look pretty.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and her favorite doll, Rosie. She played on the swings, slid down the slide, and ran around with Rosie. Lily had so much fun!
But then, it was time to go home. Lily was very tired and forgot Rosie at the park. When they got home, she realized Rosie was gone. Lily cried and cried, but Rosie was lost forever. The end.
