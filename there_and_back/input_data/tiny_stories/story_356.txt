Once upon a time, in a big blue sea, there lived a lonely fish named Finn. Finn had no friends because he was a very tiny fish. All the other fish were big and did not want to play with him. This made Finn very sad.
One day, Finn found a shiny scale on the sea floor. He thought that maybe if he wore the scale, the other fish would want to be his friend. So, he put the scale on and swam around the sea, looking for new friends.
Finn saw a group of fish playing near a coral reef. He swam up to them and said, "Hi, I'm Finn. Can I play with you?" The fish looked at Finn and saw his shiny scale. They thought it was very special. They all said, "Yes, Finn, we would love to play with you!" From that day on, Finn was never lonely again. He had many friends who would always invite him to play. And they all lived happily ever after.
