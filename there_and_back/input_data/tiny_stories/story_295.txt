Once upon a time, there was a modest little girl named Sally. Sally loved to cook. One day, she wanted to make muffins for her friends.
Sally asked her mom, "Can I cook muffins today?" Her mom said, "Yes, you can. Let's cook muffins together." They got all the things they needed and started to cook.
Sally and her mom mixed everything in a big bowl. They poured the mix into small cups. Then, they put the cups in the oven. The muffins cooked and got big and yummy.
When the muffins were ready, Sally took them to her friends. They all said, "Thank you, Sally! We love muffins!" They ate the muffins and had a fun time.
From that day on, Sally and her mom cooked muffins often. They shared them with friends and family. Everyone loved Sally's modest muffins.
