One day, a boy named Tim went to a modern gym. He wanted to play with all the toys there. He saw a big truck that he could load with blocks. Tim was so happy.
Another boy named Sam came to the gym too. He saw Tim playing with the truck. Sam wanted to play with the truck too, but Tim did not want to share. Sam was sad.
Then, a nice lady who worked at the gym saw the boys. She told Tim and Sam that they could both play with the truck and load the blocks. They could take turns. Tim and Sam became friends and had lots of fun at the gym.
