Once upon a time, there was a little red car named Beep. Beep loved to drive very fast. One day, Beep saw a big hill and thought, "I want to go up that hill!" So Beep started to drive up the hill, but it was very hard. Beep saw a gear on the ground and thought, "Maybe this gear will help me go up the hill!"
Beep put the gear in and tried to go up the hill again. This time, Beep went up the hill a little bit, but not all the way. Beep was sad and didn't know what to do. Then, Beep saw a big truck named Rumble coming down the hill.
Beep and Rumble met at the bottom of the hill. Beep told Rumble about the gear and the hill. Rumble said, "I can help you, Beep!" Rumble put the gear in Beep and together, they went up the hill. When they got to the top, Beep was so happy! Beep and Rumble became best friends and they drove up and down the hill all day long.
