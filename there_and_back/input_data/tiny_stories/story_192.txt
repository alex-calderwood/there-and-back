Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man who had a big house. He had a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to hug her dad every day. She was a very happy little girl.
One day, Lily saw a bicycle in the big house. She wanted to ride it, but she was too small. She asked her dad, "Can you help me ride the bicycle?" Her dad said, "Yes, I will help you."
Lily and her dad went outside to ride the bicycle. Her dad held the bicycle while Lily sat on it. They went up and down the street. Lily was so happy! After they finished, Lily hugged her dad and said, "Thank you, dad! I love you."
