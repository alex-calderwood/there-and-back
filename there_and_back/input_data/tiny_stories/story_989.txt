Once upon a time, there was a serious penguin named Bob. Bob liked to zip around on the ice. He was very fast and all the other penguins liked to watch him.
One day, Bob saw a big hill of snow. He wanted to zip down the hill very fast. So, Bob climbed up the hill with his little penguin feet. When he got to the top, he looked down and felt excited.
Bob took a deep breath and zipped down the hill. He went so fast that all the other penguins cheered for him. When he got to the bottom, he was very happy. From that day on, Bob loved to zip down snowy hills and make his friends smile.
