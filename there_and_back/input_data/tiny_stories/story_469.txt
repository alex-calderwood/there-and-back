Once upon a time, there was a club where animals liked to play. The club was near a deep pond. In the pond, there were fish that liked to splash.
One day, a little duck went to the club. The duck wanted to play with the other animals. But the other animals were scared of the deep pond. They did not want to splash with the duck.
The duck had an idea. It showed the other animals how fun it was to splash in the deep pond. The animals saw the duck was safe, and they all joined the duck. They had a great time splashing in the pond at the club.
