Once upon a time, in a huge house, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play and make a lot of noise. One day, his mommy asked him to stay quiet for a little while. She had a surprise for him.
Tim tried his best to stay quiet. He played with his toys and didn't make any noise. He waited and waited for the surprise. Finally, his mommy called him into the living room.
There, Tim saw a huge, colorful balloon! It was bigger than him! He was so happy and thanked his mommy for the surprise. From that day on, Tim knew that sometimes it's good to stay quiet and listen to mommy.
