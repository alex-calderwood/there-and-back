Once upon a time, there was a big, fierce lion named Leo. He lived in a jungle with many other animals. One day, a small bird named Bella came to the jungle. Bella was very scared of the fierce lion.
Leo wanted to display that he was the strongest in the jungle. He roared very loud and scared all the animals. But Bella was not scared. Instead, she flew over to Leo and gave him a hug. This was very unexpected.
The hug made Leo feel happy and less fierce. He realized that being strong was not the most important thing. From that day on, Leo and Bella were best friends and they played together in the jungle. The other animals were not scared of Leo anymore.
