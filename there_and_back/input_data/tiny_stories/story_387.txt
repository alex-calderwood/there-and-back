Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom was very sleepy. He wanted to take a nap, but he was also very thirsty. He went to the kitchen to find something to drink.
In the kitchen, Tom saw a big bottle of squash. He loved squash! It was his favorite drink. Tom poured some squash into a cup and drank it all up. It made him feel much better.
Now that Tom was not thirsty anymore, he went back to his room. He was still sleepy, so he climbed into his cozy bed. Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep. He had sweet dreams about playing with his friends and drinking more squash.
