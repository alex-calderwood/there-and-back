Once upon a time, there was a turkey. Her feathers were pale and she was very friendly. She walked around the farm, looking for someone to play with.
She saw a little girl, about 3 years old, playing in the grass. The turkey waddled over to the girl and smiled.
"What's your name?" asked the turkey. 
The little girl smiled and said, "My name is Betty."
"Hi Betty, my name is Turkey. Would you like to play a game?" asked the turkey.
Betty smiled and said, "Sure!" 
So the two of them played hide and seek around the farm. They had so much fun, they played until the sun went down. 
Betty smiled and said goodbye to Turkey. She waved goodbye and went home.
Turkey watched her until she was out of sight. Then she smiled, happy to have made a new friend.
