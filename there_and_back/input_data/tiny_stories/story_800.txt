Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Molly. She was three years old and very curious. She had a huge box full of things to play with, which included a skull. Molly wanted to take the skull outside to show her friends.
Her mom wouldn't let her take the skull out of the house. She warned Molly that it was too dangerous. Molly wasn't sure why the skull was so special but she was determined to show it to her friends.
So she waited until her mom was distracted, then grabbed the skull and quickly ran outside. She showed the skull to her best friend and they both laughed. But then a bright light shined down from the sky. It made the skull glow, and Molly's mom was there. She had followed Molly to make sure she was safe.
Molly's mom was mad at first, but then she smiled and thanked Molly for finding the special skull. She explained that it must have been magical, because it was glowing in the light. Molly was so glad she listened to her mom, and that she was able to show her friends the special skull!
