Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She was worry-worry about her cocoa milk. She wanted it to be delivered to her for a snack.
One day, Sue bravely asked her mom to deliver the cocoa milk.
“Mommy, can you deliver the cocoa milk to me please?” Sue asked.
“Yes, of course dear,” mommy said.
Mommy quickly brought Sue the cocoa milk she had asked for. Sue was so happy to have the treat - it had delivered just in time.
The end.
