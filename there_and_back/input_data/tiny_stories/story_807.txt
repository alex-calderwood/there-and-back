One day, a modest cat named Tim went to the store. Tim wanted to make a pastry for his friend, Sam. He got some flour, sugar, and butter. He was very happy.
At home, Tim began to make the pastry. He added flour, sugar, and butter in a big bowl. He mixed it all up. Then, he heard a knock on the door. It was Sam! "Hi Tim, what are you doing?" Sam asked. Tim said, "I am making a pastry for you, but it is not done yet."
Sam was excited and wanted to help. They both worked together. They added more flour, sugar, and butter. They mixed and mixed. Then, they put the pastry in the oven. They waited and talked.
When the pastry was done, they took it out of the oven. But, oh no! The pastry was not a pastry anymore. It was a big, funny cake! They both laughed and laughed. They ate the cake and had a great time. The pastry surprise was better than they thought.
