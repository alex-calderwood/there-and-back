Once upon a time there was a little girl who had a scary experience one day. She was playing in the park when a big black bird flew out of a tree. It made a loud noise and scared the little girl. She started to cry and didn't know what to do.
The girl's mom heard her cries and ran to her. She hugged her and asked her what was wrong. The little girl told her that the bird had scared her. The mom felt sorry for her daughter and tried to calm her down. She hugged the girl tight and reassured her that it was okay. 
The next day, the little girl went back to the park, but didn't go near the tree where the bird had been. She was still scared, but her mom reminded her that the bird was gone and she would be okay. To make her daughter smile again, the mom took her to the playground and they had a wonderful day. 
At the end of the day, the little girl was hesitant to leave the park, but the mom reminded her that nothing bad would happen. The little girl hugged her mom and smiled, feeling much better.
