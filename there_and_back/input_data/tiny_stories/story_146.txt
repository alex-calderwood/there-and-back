One day, a little girl named Amy went to a store with her mom. They were in a hurry because they had to go to a party. At the store, Amy saw a beautiful navy dress. It was so pretty, she wanted it.
Amy asked her mom, "Can I have the navy dress, please?" Her mom looked at the price and said, "This dress is expensive, Amy. We can find another one that is not so costly."
Amy was sad, but she knew her mom was right. They looked around the store and found another pretty dress that was not expensive. Amy tried it on and it was perfect. They bought the dress and hurried to the party. Amy had a great time and everyone loved her new dress.
