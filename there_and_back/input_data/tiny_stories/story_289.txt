One day, a dog named Sam found an unknown toy in the yard. It was a long chain. Sam was very happy and played with the chain all day. He showed his new toy to his friend, Tom the cat.
"Look, Tom! I found a new toy!" said Sam. Tom looked at the chain and said, "Be careful, Sam. We don't know where it came from."
Sam did not listen to Tom. He played with the chain all day and all night. He did not eat or rest. He was very tired, but he did not want to stop playing with the chain.
One morning, Sam was too tired to play anymore. He fell down and did not get up. Tom tried to help him, but it was too late. Sam should have listened to Tom and taken a rest.
