Once upon a time, there was a green bug. The bug lived in a big, green tree. The bug had many friends. They played in the tree every day. They had lots of fun.
One day, a big wind came. The wind made the tree shake. The bug and his friends started to panic. They were very scared. The green bug had an idea. He told his friends to hold on tight to the tree. They all held on tight.
The wind stopped. The bug and his friends were safe. They learned that when they panic, they must think and work together. They were happy they helped each other. The green bug and his friends played in the tree again. They knew they would be okay if they stayed together.
