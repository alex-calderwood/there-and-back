Once upon a time, there was an intelligent dog named Max. Max loved to eat sausages. One day, Max's friend, a little bird, came to tell him something. "Max, I know where we can find the best sausages!" said the little bird.
Max and the little bird went on a fun trip to find the sausages. They walked and walked, and finally, they saw a big tree. The little bird told Max, "We are close, Max! The sausages are near!"
Max could smell the sausages, and he was very happy. He found the sausages under the big tree. Max and the little bird ate the sausages and had a great time. They knew that they would always remember this fun day.
The next day, Max told all his friends about the tasty sausages and the big tree. They all wanted to go find more sausages too. Max and the little bird promised to show them the way. They all went on a big trip to find the sausages, and they had even more fun than before.
