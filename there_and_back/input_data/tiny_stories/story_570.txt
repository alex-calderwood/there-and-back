Once there was a man who had a really sharp knife. One day he needed to use it for something but he was scared. He went outside and he saw a skull.
The man said to the skull, "I am fearful of using this knife."
The skull replied, "You should be. It is very sharp."
The man was so scared that he dropped the knife and he ran away. He never wanted to see the skull or the sharp knife ever again!
