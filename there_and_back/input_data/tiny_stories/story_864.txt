Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Tom. He lived in a small house with a girl named Sue. One day, Sue found a pretty jewel in the garden. She was very happy and showed it to Tom.
Tom wanted the jewel to belong to him. But Sue said, "No, Tom, this jewel is mine." Tom was angry and wanted to find a way to get the jewel. He thought and thought.
At night, Tom took the jewel and ran away from the house. He was so happy that the jewel now belonged to him. But soon, he got lost and could not find his way back home. Tom was very sad and missed Sue. Now, he had the jewel, but he did not have a home or a friend.
