Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He liked to work with his dad. They worked at the post place. It was a fun job. They put things in boxes and sent them to people.
One day, it was icy outside. Tim and his dad were very cold. They worked fast to stay warm. Then, something unexpected happened. A big box came to the post place. It was a very big box. Tim and his dad did not know what was inside.
They opened the box, and guess what? It was a big, warm coat! Tim and his dad were so happy. They put on the warm coat and shared it. Now, they were not cold anymore. They laughed and went back to work. The icy day was not cold for Tim and his dad anymore. And they worked happily ever after.
