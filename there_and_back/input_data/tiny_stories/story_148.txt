Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play music with toys. Tom has a drum. Lily has a horn. They make loud sounds with their toys.
One day, they go to the park with their mom and dad. They see a big band playing music. They are eager to watch and listen. They see drums, horns, guitars, and more. They hear fast and slow songs. They clap and dance.
"Can we play with them?" Tom asks his mom.
"No, sweetie, they are playing for everyone. We can only watch and listen," his mom says.
Tom and Lily are sad. They want to play music too. They look at their toys. They have an idea.
They go to a quiet spot in the park. They put their toys on the ground. They find sticks and stones. They snap the sticks and hit the stones. They make new sounds with their toys.
"Look, we have a band too!" Lily says.
They play their own music. They have fun. They are happy.
