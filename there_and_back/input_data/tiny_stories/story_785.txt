Once upon a time, there was a little gray cat. The cat liked to play with a toy called chess. She would push the pieces with her paws and have so much fun.
One day, the cat found a big red ball. She wanted to play with the ball, but she could not release it from the string. The cat tried and tried, but the ball would not let go.
Then, a friendly dog came to help. The dog used his teeth to release the ball from the string. The gray cat and the friendly dog played with the ball and the chess toy. They had lots of fun and became best friends.
