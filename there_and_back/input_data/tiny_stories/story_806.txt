Once upon a time, there was a big orange cat named Tom. Tom had a friend, a little blue bird named Tim. They liked to play and have fun together. One day, they saw a big box of toys. The toys were all in pairs that matched.
Tom and Tim wanted to find the toy that matched their colors. They looked and looked, but they could not find the right match. They started to fight over the toys. Tom said, "I want the orange toy!" Tim said, "No! I want the blue toy!"
Their friend, a wise old owl, saw the fight and came to help. The owl said, "You should not fight, friends. Share the toys and play together." Tom and Tim listened to the wise owl. They stopped fighting and shared the toys. They found out that playing together was more fun than fighting.
The moral of the story is: Sharing is better than fighting.
