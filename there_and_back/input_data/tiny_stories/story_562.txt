Once upon a time, there was a clever cat named Kitty. She had a job to catch mice in the big house. One day, she saw a little mouse named Mikey. Kitty wanted to catch Mikey, but she had a question for him first.
Kitty asked Mikey, "Why do you come in my big house?" Mikey said, "I am hungry and I want to find food." Kitty thought about it and said, "If you help me with my job, I will give you some food."
Mikey agreed and they worked together. But one day, Kitty forgot to give Mikey food. Mikey was very hungry and sad. So, Mikey decided to take all the food and leave the big house.
Kitty could not find Mikey and was sad too. She could not do her job alone. The big house had many mice now, and Kitty lost her job. This is a bad ending for Kitty and Mikey, because they did not work together and share the food.
