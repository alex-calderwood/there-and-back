One day, a little boy named Tom was playing in the park. He saw a small bug struggle to climb a big rock. Tom wanted to help the bug, so he put his thumb on the rock and let the bug climb on it. Then, he moved his thumb up to the top of the rock. The bug was very happy and said, "Thank you, Tom!"
Tom saw a girl named Sue playing with a ball. Sue was not nice and was being rude to other kids. She did not want to share her ball. Tom walked over to Sue and said, "It is not nice to be rude. We should share and play together."
Just then, the bug from the rock came back with lots of other bugs. They all wanted to help Tom and Sue play together. The bugs made a big circle around the ball, and Tom and Sue started to play. They laughed and had fun, and Sue learned that sharing was good.
