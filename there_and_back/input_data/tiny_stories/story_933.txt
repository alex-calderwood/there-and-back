One day, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went to the park. They loved to play with the ball. Tim threw the ball and Spot ran to catch it. They were having a lot of fun.
Then, Tim's mom came and said, "I have some news. We will eat dinner soon. It will be delicious." Tim did not want to stop playing. He said, "But I want to play more." His mom insisted, "We must go home now."
So, Tim and Spot went home with his mom. At home, they ate a delicious dinner. Tim was happy he listened to his mom. After dinner, Tim and Spot played more games. They had a great day.
