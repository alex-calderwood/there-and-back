One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the mall with her mom. They walked around and saw many nice things. Lucy noticed a big, heavy ball. She wanted to play with it.
"Mom, can I play with the heavy ball?" asked Lucy.
Her mom said, "Yes, but be careful not to drop it."
Lucy played with the heavy ball and had lots of fun. She rolled it and bounced it. Then, she saw her friend Tom at the mall. Tom noticed the heavy ball too.
"Hi, Tom! Want to play with my heavy ball?" Lucy asked.
Tom said, "Yes, let's play!" They played with the heavy ball together and had a great time at the mall.
