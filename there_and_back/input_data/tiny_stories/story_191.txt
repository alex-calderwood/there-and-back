One day, a little boy named Tim went to the kitchen. He saw a big sink. He wanted to listen to the water. So, he turned the tap on. The water went drip, drip, drip. Tim liked the sound.
Tim's mom came into the kitchen. She saw the water and said, "Tim, why is the sink on?" Tim said, "I like to listen to the water, Mom." His mom smiled and said, "Okay, but don't let the water run too long."
Tim was persistent. He kept listening to the water. Then, something unexpected happened. A small fish came out of the tap! Tim was so surprised. He looked at the fish and said, "Hello, little fish!"
The fish said, "Hello, Tim! I came from the water world to be your friend." Tim was very happy. He and the fish played and talked all day. They became the best of friends.
