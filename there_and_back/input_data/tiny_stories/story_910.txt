Tom and Lily are playing with their new toys. Tom has a red car and Lily has a pink doll. They make noises and move their toys around the floor.
"Beep beep! My car is fast!" Tom says.
"Hello! My doll is pretty!" Lily says.
They are having fun, but then they hear a sound from the kitchen. It is Mom. She is calling them.
"Tom! Lily! Come here! I have a surprise for you!" Mom says.
Tom and Lily pause their game. They look at each other and smile. They love surprises. They run to the kitchen.
"What is it, Mom?" Tom asks.
"Look! I made you some cookies! And I have some cream for you to put on them!" Mom says.
She shows them a plate of warm cookies and a bowl of white cream. Tom and Lily clap their hands. They love cookies and cream.
"Thank you, Mom! You are the best!" Lily says.
They each take a cookie and dip it in the cream. They bite into them and make happy sounds.
"Mmm! This is yummy!" Tom says.
"Yes, it is! Can we have more?" Lily asks.
"Of course, you can. But only after you finish your cookie and cream. And don't forget to share!" Mom says.
Tom and Lily nod. They finish their cookie and cream and ask for another one. They share with each other and with Mom. They are very happy. They hug Mom and thank her again.
"Can we go back to play with our new toys now?" Tom asks.
"Sure, you can. But remember to clean up your mess and wash your hands first!" Mom says.
Tom and Lily agree. They clean up their mess and wash their hands. They run back to their room and resume their game. They are still having fun, but now they are also full of cookies and cream.
