Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big tree with many green leaves. They want to climb the tree.
"Look, Mia, there is a spot on the tree. It is high and round. Maybe it is a bird's nest," Tom says.
"Let's go and see, Tom. Maybe we can find some eggs or feathers," Mia says.
They hold hands and walk to the tree. They find a low branch and pull themselves up. They climb higher and higher, until they reach the spot.
"Wow, Tom, you are right. It is a bird's nest. And look, there are three blue eggs inside," Mia says.
"Shh, Mia, be quiet. We don't want to scare the bird. Maybe it is coming back soon," Tom says.
They sit on the branch and watch the nest. They are happy and curious. They wait for the bird to come back. They hope it is a nice bird.
