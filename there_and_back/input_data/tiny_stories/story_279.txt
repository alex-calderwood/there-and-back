Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Spot. Spot loved to play and eat. One day, Spot found a big bowl of yogurt. Spot had never seen yogurt before, but it looked good.
Spot took a small bite of the yogurt. It was so yummy! Spot ate and ate until the bowl was empty. Spot was very happy. He wanted to share the yogurt with his friends.
Spot went to find his friends. He found a cat, a bird, and a frog. Spot said, "Welcome, friends! I found a yummy thing called yogurt. Let's find more and eat it together!" The friends all agreed and went to look for more yogurt. They found a big store with lots of yogurt and shared it with each other. They all loved the yogurt and were very happy.
