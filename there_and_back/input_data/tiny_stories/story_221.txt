One day, a bird wanted to fly high in the sky. The bird saw a vendor who sold food. The vendor had a clear jar with yummy treats inside. The bird wanted some treats from the vendor, but the vendor did not give any to the bird.
The bird had an idea. It tried to fly fast and grab the clear jar from the vendor. The bird thought the jar was full of treats, but it was not. The jar was full of seeds for planting. The bird was sad, but it did not give up.
The bird took the seeds and planted them in the ground. After some time, the seeds grew into big, beautiful trees with sweet fruits. The bird was happy now. It could eat the fruits and fly high in the sky. The vendor saw the trees and was surprised. The bird and the vendor became friends, and they shared the fruits from the trees.
