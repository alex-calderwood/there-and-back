Once upon a time there was a graceful bird called Joy. She was very shiny and loved to fly in the sunshine. One day, Joy flew to a magical pond where the water glowed like a glass. Joy was so amazed that she flew closer to the glowing pond.
Suddenly, a soft voice said “Hello Joy, welcome to my pond!” Joy looked around and saw a small frog sitting on a nearby lily pad. “Oh, hello frog!” said Joy.
The frog kindly invited Joy to join her in the water. Joy happily agreed, jumped into the pond and started to play. She splashed her feet as the water continued to glow. 
The frog smiled with joy. “This pond is special," she said, “It glows when I am happy and then, it glows even brighter!”
