Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lu. Lu loved to collect all sorts of things – from colourful flowers to pretty shells she would find at the beach.
One day, Lu went to an old house in the woods and found a very special closet. It was an ugly closet, but Lu knew it was magical. She opened it and collected all kinds of things – from sparkly jewels, to dolls, to candy!
Lu couldn’t believe her luck – each item was more wonderful than the last! She was about to take everything back with her when suddenly she heard a voice.
“What are you doing in my closet?” it said.
Lu gasped and looked up. An old witch was standing at the entrance with a scowl on her face.
“If you want to keep collecting,” the witch said, “you must do something for me in return.”
Lu agreed immediately. Now, she treasures the things in her closet and visits the old witch from time to time.
