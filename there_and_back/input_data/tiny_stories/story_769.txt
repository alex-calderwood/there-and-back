Once upon a time, there was a smart cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to act like a dog. She would wag her tail, bark, and play fetch with her friends.
One day, Kitty met a new friend named Mouse. Mouse was very shy. Kitty thought it would be fun to act like a dog to make Mouse laugh. So, Kitty barked and wagged her tail. Mouse laughed and said, "You are so funny, Kitty!"
Later, they went to the kitchen to find a tasty snack. They found a box of salt. "Let's try this," said Mouse. They tasted the salt and made a funny face. "This is not a good snack!" Kitty said. They laughed and looked for a better snack together. They found some cheese and shared it. Kitty and Mouse were very happy and became the best of friends.
