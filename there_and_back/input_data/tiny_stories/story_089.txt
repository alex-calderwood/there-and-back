Once upon a time, there was a great big cat named Tom. Tom liked to play all day long. He would run, jump, and chase his toy mouse. One day, Tom felt very tired after playing so much.
Tom let out a big yawn, showing his lips. He decided it was time for a nap. He found a soft and warm spot to sleep. Tom curled up and closed his eyes, dreaming about more fun games to play.
When Tom woke up, he felt great! He was ready to play again. He stretched and yawned one more time. Tom ran to find his toy mouse and started to play. He was happy and full of energy.
