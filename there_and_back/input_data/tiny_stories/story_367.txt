Once upon a time, there was a shy little dog named Tim. He was scared to play with the other dogs in the park. Tim had a rubber ball that he loved to play with at home. One day, Tim had a dream that he played with his rubber ball in the park with all the other dogs.
In Tim's dream, he was not shy anymore. He played and laughed with the other dogs. They all loved his rubber ball, and they took turns playing with it. Tim was very happy in his dream. He wished he could be brave like that when he was awake.
The next day, Tim took his rubber ball to the park. He was still a little shy, but he remembered his dream. He took a deep breath and started to play with the other dogs. They all had fun playing with the rubber ball, just like in Tim's dream. Tim learned that it's okay to be shy, but it's also good to be brave and make new friends.
