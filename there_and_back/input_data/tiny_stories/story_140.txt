Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lisa. She liked to drink juice. One day she noticed a letter in her garden. It was very calm and peaceful. She slowly opened the letter and to her surprise, a giant glass of juice was inside. The letter said: 'Drink this juicy drink to be happy!' 
So Lisa happily took a sip. The juice was delicious. She kept drinking, until the glass was empty. She smiled, feeling full of joy and feeling very calm. 
From then on, Lisa always looked around for letters in the garden. She knew that she could find something special inside, like juice!
