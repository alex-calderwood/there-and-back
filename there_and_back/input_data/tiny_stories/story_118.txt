Once upon a time, there was a kind cat. The cat liked to play with a red ball. One day, the cat saw a big house. The cat wanted to enter the house to look for more fun things to play with.
Inside the house, the cat found a box. The box had many pieces inside. The cat played with the pieces and had fun. The cat heard a noise and saw a dog. The cat was scared of the dog.
But, the dog was also kind. The dog wanted to play too. The cat and the dog played with the pieces together. They had so much fun. Now, the cat and the dog are best friends.
