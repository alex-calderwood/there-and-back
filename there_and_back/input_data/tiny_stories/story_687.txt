One day, a little girl named Lucy went out to wander. She saw a delicate flower and a rubber ball. She picked up the ball and threw it. The ball bounced high and far away.
Lucy followed the ball and met a small boy named Tom. Tom said, "Hey, that's my rubber ball!" Lucy said, "I'm sorry, I found it and threw it." Tom said, "It's okay, let's play together."
They played with the ball, but then something unexpected happened. The ball hit the delicate flower and it started to grow bigger and bigger! Lucy and Tom were amazed. They became friends and played together every day.
