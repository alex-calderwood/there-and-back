Once upon a time, there was a young baby named Tim. Tim loved to clap his hands all day. He clapped when he was happy, and he clapped when he was sad. Tim's clapping made everyone around him smile.
One sunny day, Tim went to the park with his mom. They saw a little bird sitting on a tree. The bird looked sad, so Tim clapped his hands to make it happy. The bird looked at Tim and said, "Thank you, Tim! Your clapping made me feel better."
Tim's mom was proud of her baby. She said, "Good job, Tim! You made the bird happy with your clapping." Tim felt happy too. From that day on, Tim and the bird became friends, and they clapped their hands and wings together, making everyone in the park happy.
