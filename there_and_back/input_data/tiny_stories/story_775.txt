One day, a boy named Tom found a big sack. He felt troubled because he did not know what was inside. He wanted to show his mom the sack, so he took it home.
When Tom showed the sack to his mom, she opened it. Inside, they found many toys. Tom was happy, and his mom was happy too. They played with the toys all day.
At night, Tom put the toys back in the sack. He was not troubled anymore. He and his mom had lots of fun with the sack of toys. They knew they would play with them again soon.
