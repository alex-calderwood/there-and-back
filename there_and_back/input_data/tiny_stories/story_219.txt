John was getting ready to go out. He put on his shirt, pants, and shoes. He made sure they were all tight. He grabbed his hat and jacket and put them on too.
John called a taxi. He heard its loud horn as it came closer. He stepped outside to meet it. The taxi driver said, "Where do you need to go?"
John said, "I need to go to the store." The taxi driver nodded and took him there. 
When John arrived, he was happy to see all the things the store had to offer. He quickly dressed in a new outfit and picked out a few things to buy. He waved goodbye to the taxi driver and made his way inside.
