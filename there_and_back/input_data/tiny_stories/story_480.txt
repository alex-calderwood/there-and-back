Once upon a time, there was a little otter. The otter had many friends in the forest. They liked to play and have fun together. But one day, the otter got upset.
The otter and his friend, the squirrel, had a quarrel. They were both angry and did not want to play anymore. The otter felt sad and went to sit by the river alone.
Soon, the squirrel came to the otter and said sorry. The otter said sorry too. They hugged and became friends again. They played near the river and were happy. The otter was not upset anymore.
