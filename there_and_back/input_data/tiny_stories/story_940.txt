One day, a little girl named Sue wanted to write a letter to her friend, Tim. She took a pen and a paper and began to write. But her little brother, Sam, saw her and wanted to help. Sam was only three years old, so he did not write very well. Sue said, "No, Sam, you can't help me. You are too little."
Sam felt very sad and ashamed. He wanted to show Sue that he could help. So, he went to the garden and found a long string. He tied a big knot in the string and brought it to Sue. "Look, Sue! I made a knot for the letter. Can I help now?" Sam asked.
Sue looked at the knot and smiled. "Yes, Sam, you can help. Thank you for the knot." She put the knot on the letter and gave it to Sam. "Now, you can take the letter to Tim's house." Sam felt so happy and proud. He walked to Tim's house and gave him the letter. Sue and Sam became a great team, and they helped each other from that day on.
