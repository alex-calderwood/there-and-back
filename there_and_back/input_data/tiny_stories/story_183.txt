Lily and Mark were best friends. They liked to play together at the park. One day, they saw a big dog with a red ball in its mouth. The dog was running and barking.
"Wow, look at that dog!" Lily said. "It has a ball. Do you think it wants to play with us?"
Mark nodded. He liked dogs. He ran towards the dog and tried to take the ball. But the dog did not like that. It growled and snapped at Mark. Mark got scared and ran back to Lily.
"Are you okay, Mark?" Lily asked. She hugged him.
Mark nodded again. He had a small scratch on his hand. It hurt a little. He felt embarrassed. He thought the dog would be friendly.
"Why did the dog do that?" Mark asked. He did not understand.
Lily tried to explain. She had learned about dogs from her big brother. "Some dogs do not like to share their toys. They think the toys are theirs. They get angry if someone tries to take them. They want to protect them. That is why the dog was mean to you. It was not your fault, Mark. You did not know."
Mark listened to Lily. He felt better. He understood. He thanked Lily for explaining. He smiled.
"Can we still play at the park?" Mark asked.
Lily smiled back. She nodded. She took Mark's hand. "Yes, we can. But let's stay away from the dog. We can play with the swings and the slide. They are more fun."
They walked to the playground. They forgot about the dog. They had a good time. They were still best friends.
