One day, a little girl named Amy went to the park. The park was quiet and she saw a big tree. Under the tree, she found a grape. The grape was round and purple. Amy picked up the grape and looked around.
She saw a small cat lying under the tree. The cat was quiet too. Amy walked to the cat and said, "Hi, cat! I found a grape. Do you want it?"
The cat looked at Amy and said, "Yes, please. I like grapes." Amy gave the grape to the cat, and the cat ate it. The cat was very happy.
After the cat ate the grape, they played together in the park. They ran and laughed. When it was time to go home, Amy said goodbye to the cat. The cat said, "Thank you for the grape, Amy. I hope we can play again soon." Amy smiled and went home, feeling happy that she made a new friend.
