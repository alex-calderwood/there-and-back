One day, a little girl named Lucy found a cube in her toy box. She did not know what it was, so she decided to examine it. The cube was shiny and had many colors on it. Lucy thought it was a lucky cube because it was so pretty.
Lucy showed the cube to her friend, Tom. Tom looked at the cube and said, "Wow, what a lucky cube! I have never seen one like this before." They both examined the cube together and tried to find out what it did.
As they played with the lucky cube, they found out that it could make funny noises when they shook it. Lucy and Tom laughed and played with the cube all day long. They were very happy to have found such a fun and lucky toy.
