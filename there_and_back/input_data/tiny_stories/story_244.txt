Once upon a time, there was a cow named Daisy. Daisy was a very filthy cow. She liked to play in the mud all day. One day, Daisy met a little bird named Bob. Bob looked at Daisy and said, "You are very dirty, Daisy. Why don't you take a bath?"
Daisy thought about it and said, "But I love playing in the mud. It makes me feel happy." Bob looked at Daisy and told her, "But if you are clean, you will feel even better, and your friends will want to play with you more."
Daisy listened to Bob and decided to take a bath. She went to the pond and washed off all the mud. Daisy felt so good and clean. She went back to her friends, and they all wanted to play with her. Daisy learned that it is important to stay clean and that being clean can make you feel good and make your friends want to be with you.
