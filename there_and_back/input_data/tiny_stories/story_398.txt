Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Tim. Tim loved to chew on things. One day, he saw a big, soft couch. He thought it would be fun to chew on the couch.
Tim started to chew on the couch. He chewed and chewed, and soon, the couch was not nice anymore. Tim's mom saw the couch and was worried. She said, "Tim, you should not chew on the couch. You should chew on your toys."
Tim felt bad for chewing on the couch. He learned that it is important to take care of things and not to chew on them. From that day on, Tim only chewed on his toys and left the couch alone. And everyone was happy.
