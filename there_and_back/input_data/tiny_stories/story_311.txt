Jimmy had a long day. He was very tired and just wanted to sleep. He had a nice warm bed just for him. As he laid down, he heard something strange. It sounded like a loud buzzing noise. Jimmy did not like the sound. He thought it was very stupid.
Jimmy's mom came into the room. She looked at Jimmy concernedly. "What is that noise," she asked.
Jimmy said, "I don't know. It's really loud and really annoying."
Jimmy's mom replied, "That's the alarm. It's to remind us to stay safe. We need to resist it."
Jimmy was confused. He didn't understand why he had to resist the alarm. But Jimmy decided to trust his mom and do as she said. 
Every morning, Jimmy heard the alarm. He knew it meant he had to resist. He tried his best to fight the sound and eventually, Jimmy got used to the buzzing. 
But then, one day the buzzing stopped. Jimmy was relieved. He didn't have to struggle anymore. The alarm had done its job and reminded Jimmy to stay safe. Jimmy had resisted the dumb alarm and now peace and quiet filled his room.
