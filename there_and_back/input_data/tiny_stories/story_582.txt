Mum and Joe were in a hurry. They had to get to the store before it closed. Joe wanted to buy some soap. Mum said there was not much time left, so they picked up the pace and ran.
When they got to the store, Joe was so excited. He ran through the aisles, looking for the soap. He stopped in front of the shelves and pointed to a box. Inside was a bar of yellow soap that smelled sweet.
Mum smiled and said it was just what they needed. But when Joe opened the box, he noticed something strange. The soap was sour! Joe looked disappointed, but he still thanked Mum for trying.
Mum told Joe that it was okay, and that they'd try again tomorrow. They had all the time in the world to find the perfect soap. Joe smiled and the two went home, happy that the day was full of surprises.
