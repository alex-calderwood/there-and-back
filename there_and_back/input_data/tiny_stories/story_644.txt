Once upon a time, there was a healthy dog named Buddy. Buddy loved to run, play, and shake his tail. One day, Buddy went on a big adventure.
Buddy found a subway. The subway was big and loud. Buddy was not scared. He wanted to see where the subway went. So, he jumped on and went for a ride.
Buddy saw many new things on the subway. He saw people, and other dogs, and even a big cat. The cat scared Buddy a little, but he just shook his tail and kept going. At the end of the day, Buddy went home. He was happy and tired from his big adventure.
