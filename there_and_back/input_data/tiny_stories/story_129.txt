Jessie was really excited. It was her first day of school and she couldn't wait to see all of her new friends. As she waited on the porch, her mom handed her a special ornament. She said, "This is for you, Jessie. It will help you be successful when you go to school today." 
Jessie looked at the ornament. It was a shiny silver star. It was beautiful. She put it in her pocket and set off for school. 
When she arrived, all of the other kids were already there. Jessie handed her teacher the ornament and watched as she passed it around the room. Everyone admired its beauty and eagerly passed it from hand to hand to look closer. 
At the end of the day, Jessie felt successful. She had made so many friends, and the star ornament had helped her feel brave and confident. She knew that she would have a successful school year.
