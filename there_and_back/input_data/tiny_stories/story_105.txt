Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Chirpy. Chirpy loved to sing. Every day, he would fly around and sing to all his friends. One day, Chirpy met a squirrel named Fluffy. Fluffy was very alert and loved to eat popcorn.
"Hi, Fluffy!" Chirpy said. "Do you want to sing with me?"
Fluffy looked at Chirpy and said, "I don't know how to sing, but I can share my popcorn with you!"
Chirpy and Fluffy sat under a big tree and ate popcorn together. They were both very happy. As they ate, Chirpy sang a happy song, and Fluffy listened.
Soon, other animals came to join them. They all shared the popcorn and listened to Chirpy sing. Everyone was happy and kind to each other.
The moral of the story is that sharing and being kind to others can bring happiness and make new friends.
