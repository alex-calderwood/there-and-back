One day, a little boy named Tim found a baseball. It was a mighty big baseball. Tim wanted to play with it. He took the baseball to the park.
At the park, Tim saw a girl named Sue. Sue looked sad. Tim asked, "Why are you sad?" Sue said, "I lost my baseball. It is a mighty big baseball."
Tim showed Sue the baseball he found. Sue smiled and said, "That is my baseball! It belongs to me." Tim gave the baseball to Sue. Now, they both were happy.
Tim and Sue played with the baseball together. They had lots of fun. They became good friends. From that day on, Tim and Sue always played with the mighty big baseball at the park.
