Once upon a time, there was a shy little cat named Kitty. Kitty was too shy to play with the other animals. She would hide behind her mom when they tried to talk to her. Kitty's mom said, "Please, Kitty, try to make some friends."
One day, Kitty saw a big well near her house. She looked inside and saw a little frog. The frog said, "Hi, I am Froggy. Will you be my friend?" Kitty was shy, but she said, "Yes, I will be your friend."
Kitty and Froggy played together every day. They would play near the well and have lots of fun. Kitty was not shy anymore. She was happy to have a friend like Froggy. And they lived happily ever after.
