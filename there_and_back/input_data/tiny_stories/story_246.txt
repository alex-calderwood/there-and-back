Once upon a time, there was a small dog named Spot. Spot loved to race with his friends in the park. He was very fast and always won the races. One day, Spot saw a big, dark cloud in the sky. He thought it looked interesting.
Spot told his friends about the dark cloud. They all decided to race to the cloud and see what it was. They ran and ran, getting closer to the cloud. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was thunder! Spot and his friends were scared.
They knew they had to race back home before the rain started. They ran as fast as they could, and just as they got home, the rain began to pour. Spot and his friends were safe and dry. They learned that even though the dark cloud looked interesting, it was better to stay close to home when the sky looked like that.
