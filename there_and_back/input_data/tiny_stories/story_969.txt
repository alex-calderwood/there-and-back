Once there was a man who loved to sell things. He sold all kinds of things in the market, like books, food and cups. 
He had a very playful cat at home. He loved it very much and took care of it. He used to play with his cat every day and it loved to tease him. 
One day, the man started to worry about money. He was worried he could not sell enough things and he would not be able to buy food for himself and his cat. 
But the man's worry did not last too long. Soon he sold many things in the market and he bought enough food for himself and his cat. They were both happy again. 
The man was happy to see his cat playful again and they both enjoyed their time together.
