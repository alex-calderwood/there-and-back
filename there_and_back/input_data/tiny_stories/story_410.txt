Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a musician. He was attractive and played beautiful music. Everyone loved to hear him play. One day, he decided to play near the river.
As he played his music, a little girl named Lily came to listen. She liked the music very much. She clapped her hands and danced to the beat. The musician smiled at her and said, "Thank you for dancing to my music."
Lily wanted to show the musician something fun. She said, "Let's play catch!" The musician agreed, and they took turns throwing a ball to each other. They laughed and played until it was time for Lily to go home.
At the end of the day, the musician and Lily said goodbye. Lily said, "I had fun today. I hope we can play catch again soon." The musician nodded and said, "I would like that too."
From that day on, the musician and Lily became good friends. They played catch and listened to music together. And they lived happily ever after.
