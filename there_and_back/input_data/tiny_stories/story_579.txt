Max and his dad were in the workshop. Dad took out a big hammer, it was shiny and had sharp edges. Max was very excited, he wanted to have a go with the hammer. 
Dad said no, it was too big and dangerous. He said Max could keep it safe in his toy box until he was old enough. Max was a bit sad, but agreed to put it away.
Every day Max would take it out and put it back, but one day he was too excited and he started hitting a block of wood with it. Dad saw, but he was so proud of Max that he let him keep playing.
Max was very proud of himself, he felt strong and big. But sometimes he could be a bit selfish. Max started using the hammer to hit the other kids' toys when they weren't in the room. 
When dad found out, he was very disappointed. He said he had taught Max to use the hammer safely, not for being selfish. 
Max realised he had made a mistake and put the hammer away. He knew he had to be more careful if he wanted to keep it.
