One day, a boy named Tom wanted to play. He saw a big tire in his yard. The tire was thick and strong. Tom had an idea. He wanted to pretend the tire was a car.
Tom said to his friend, Sam, "Let's play pretend. This tire is our car." Sam was happy and they both sat in the tire. They made car sounds and drove to a pretend store.
At the store, they met a dog. The dog said, "Woof! Can I play too?" Tom and Sam said, "Yes! You can be our pet in the car." They all played together and had lots of fun.
