One day, a little girl named Amy was in the kitchen with her mom. Amy's mom was cooking on the huge stove. Amy wanted to help her mom cook, so she asked, "Mom, can I put something in the pot?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Amy. You can put some carrots in the pot." Amy was very happy to help her mom. She picked up the carrots and put them in the pot on the stove.
After they finished cooking, Amy and her mom sat down to eat their yummy soup. They both loved the soup, and Amy was proud that she helped her mom cook. From that day on, Amy always helped her mom in the kitchen, and they had lots of fun cooking together.
