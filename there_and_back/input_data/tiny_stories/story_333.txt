Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They saw a big pipe that was high and round. They wanted to climb on it and see what was inside.
"Let's go up there!" Tom said. "Maybe we can find something fun!"
Lily nodded and followed Tom. They used a ladder to reach the pipe. They crawled inside and saw many things. There were rocks, sticks, cans, and papers. They looked like treasures to them.
"Wow, look at all this!" Lily said. "Let's take some and show mom and dad!"
They started to grab the things and put them in their pockets. They did not see the sign that said "Do not touch. This pipe is for water."
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. Water started to gush out of the pipe. It was cold and wet. It pushed them out of the pipe and onto the ground. They were soaked and scared.
"Help, help!" they cried. "We are sorry, we are sorry!"
A man came running. He was the park keeper. He saw the water and the pipe and the sign. He saw Lily and Tom and their pockets full of things.
"What have you done?" he asked. "You have scattered the water and made a mess. You have taken things that do not belong to you. You have broken the rules. You have been very naughty!"
Lily and Tom felt ashamed. They apologized to the man. They gave back the things they had taken. They helped him clean up the water and the pipe. They learned their lesson.
They learned that they should not go where they are not allowed. They learned that they should not take what is not theirs. They learned that they should listen to the signs and the rules. They learned that being curious is good, but being careful is better.
