Once there was a turtle named Tom. Tom was green and liked to sleep in the sun. 
One day he saw a teaspoon on the ground and thought it looked interesting. He decided to settle down and take a nap on the spoon. Tom was so comfortable that he quickly fell asleep. 
Suddenly, Tom heard someone screaming. It was a little girl. She ran up to Tom and said "What are you doing there? That is my teaspoon!" Tom bobbed his head in surprise and tried to wiggle away but it was too late - the girl had grabbed him up in her hand.
Tom squirmed and begged to be let go, but the girl only laughed. She said, "I can't let you go, because you decided to settle on my teaspoon!" With that, the girl walked away, never to be seen again.
Tom was never able to go back to his sunny spot. He was forever stuck in the little girl's hand.
