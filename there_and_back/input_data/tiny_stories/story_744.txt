Nate was a three year old boy. He was very happy. Every morning, he liked to go for a walk. Nate liked to find shadows to play and tease.
One day, he saw a lovely shadow on the wall. He thought it was really fun, so he started to tease it. He jumped around and laughed. 
Suddenly, there was a loud noise. It was a car. Nate screamed and the shadow disappeared.
When Nate got home, he realised that he was not so happy anymore. He had not been careful, and now he could not find the lovely shadow he had teased earlier. 
Nate was very sad. He had made a mistake and was very disappointed. He cried and learned an important lesson - it is not always good to tease!
