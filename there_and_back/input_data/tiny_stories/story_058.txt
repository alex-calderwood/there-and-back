Once upon a time, there was a powerful man. This man had a special thing he could do. He could balance on a razor. 
One day, he went to the park to show off his trick. The people at the park watched him. They were amazed. They thought he was the best. 
But then, something unexpected happened. A tiny ant walked up to the razor. The ant was so small, but it could balance on the razor too! The people at the park cheered for the ant. The powerful man was surprised. He learned that even small things can be amazing.
