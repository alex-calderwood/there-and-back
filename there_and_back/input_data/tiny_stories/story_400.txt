Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sue. Sue had a diary. She wrote in her diary every day. She wrote about her regular days.
One day, Sue wanted to test her friend, Tom. She asked Tom, "What do you think I write in my diary?" Tom thought for a moment and said, "You write about your days, and what you do."
Sue smiled and said, "You are right, Tom! I write about my regular days. I write about playing, eating, and sleeping. I like to remember what I do."
Tom was happy he guessed right. Sue and Tom played together and had fun. They were good friends. And Sue kept writing in her diary every day.
