Lily and Ben liked to play with cardboard. They cut it, painted it, and made it into different things. One day, they found a big cardboard box in the garage. They decided to make it into a spaceship.
They worked hard to decorate the box with stickers, crayons, and foil. They made a door, a window, and a steering wheel. They were very proud of their spaceship. They wanted to fly to the moon and see the stars.
But there was a problem. The box was too small for both of them. They could not fit inside together. They tried to squeeze, but it was no use. They started to argue. Lily said it was her box, because she found it first. Ben said it was his box, because he made the steering wheel. They both wanted to fly the spaceship alone.
Then, Mom came and saw them fighting. She asked them what was wrong. They told her about the box and the spaceship. Mom smiled and said she had an idea. She went to the garage and came back with another cardboard box. She said they could part the first box and use the second box to make a bigger spaceship. That way, they could both fly together.
Lily and Ben liked Mom's idea. They said sorry to each other and hugged. They were generous and shared their cardboard. They used scissors, tape, and glue to join the two boxes. They made a bigger door, a bigger window, and two steering wheels. They finished their spaceship and climbed inside. They pretended to blast off and fly to the moon. They had a lot of fun and were very happy.
