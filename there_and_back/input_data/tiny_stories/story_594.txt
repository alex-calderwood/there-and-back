One day, a big dog and a little cat were playing in the yard. The dog saw some mud and wanted to play in it. The cat did not like mud, so she said, "No, I don't want to play in the mud."
The dog did not listen and started to tear the mud with his paws. The mud went everywhere, even on the cat. The cat was not happy and said, "You are not being honest, you said we would play together, but now I am all dirty."
The dog felt bad and said, "I am sorry, I did not mean to make you dirty." The cat and the dog decided to find a new game to play together that did not have mud. They both learned to be honest and listen to each other's feelings.
