One day, a little boy named Tim found a big, filthy toy in the park. It was a stuffed bear with a tear near its mouth. Tim wanted to take the bear home, but his mom said, "No, Tim, that toy is dirty. We can't take it home."
Tim was sad but he listened to his mom. Later, he saw another boy named Sam playing with the same filthy bear. Sam didn't know about the tear near the bear's mouth. Tim went to Sam and said, "Hey, be careful with that bear. It has a tear near its mouth."
Sam looked at the bear and saw the tear. He was sad too, but he thanked Tim for telling him. They both decided to leave the bear in the park and play together with their own toys. Tim and Sam became good friends and had lots of fun playing in the park every day.
