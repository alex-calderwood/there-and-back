Once upon a time, there was a fancy alarm clock. It was red and shiny. It lived on a table next to a girl's bed. Every morning, the alarm clock would ring loudly to wake the girl up.
One day, the girl tried to twist the alarm clock's hands. She wanted to change the time. But the hands did not move. The girl was sad. She wanted the alarm clock to ring at a different time.
The next morning, the girl's mom saw the fancy alarm clock. She knew how to twist the hands. She showed the girl how to do it. The girl was happy. Now, she could change the time on her fancy alarm clock.
