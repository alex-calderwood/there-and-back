Once upon a time, a little dog named Spot went for a walk. Spot saw a distant trail and wanted to join it. He wagged his tail and ran to the trail. The trail had many trees and pretty flowers. Spot was very happy.
As Spot walked on the trail, he met a big cat. The cat was not nice. The cat said, "You cannot join me on this trail, Spot. Go away!" Spot was sad, but he kept walking on the trail. He hoped to find a friend.
Spot walked and walked, but he did not find a friend. The trail became dark and scary. Spot was very tired and sad. He wanted to go home, but he was lost. Spot sat down and cried. The trail was not fun anymore.
