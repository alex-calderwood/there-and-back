Anna loved to bake with her aunt. They made cakes and pies and cookies. Anna liked to stir and pour and taste. Her aunt liked to smile and hug and teach.
One day, Anna and her aunt were baking a big cake for Anna's birthday. They mixed the flour and the eggs and the sugar in a bowl. They added some milk and some butter and some vanilla. They poured the batter in a pan and put it in the oven.
"Can I lick the spoon, auntie?" Anna asked.
"Of course, sweetie. But be careful, it's sticky," her aunt said.
Anna licked the spoon and made a happy noise. She gave her aunt a sticky kiss. Her aunt laughed and wiped her face.
They waited for the cake to bake. They smelled the sweet aroma. They heard the timer beep.
"It's ready, auntie! Can we take it out?" Anna said.
"Yes, we can. But we need to use oven mitts, because it's very hot," her aunt said.
She opened the oven and reached for the pan. But she gasped and dropped it. The cake fell on the floor.
"Auntie, what's wrong?" Anna said.
"I'm sorry, Anna. I'm feeling weak. I need to sit down," her aunt said.
She looked pale and tired. She held her chest.
Anna was scared. She ran to the phone and called for help. She remembered what her aunt had taught her. She said her name and address and what happened.
"Please come fast. My aunt is sick. We were baking a cake," she said.
She hung up and ran back to her aunt. She held her hand and said, "Don't worry, auntie. Help is coming. I love you."
She hoped her aunt would be okay. She hoped they could bake another cake. She hoped they could smile and hug and teach again.
