Once upon a time, there was a curious little dragon. He loved to look, touch, and play with everything he saw. He was very happy and always had fun.
One day, the little dragon went to a big party with all his friends. There were games, food, and music. The little dragon wanted to dance, but he was scared. He thought his friends would laugh at him and he would embarrass himself.
But, his friends saw him and said, "Come on, little dragon! Let's dance together!" The little dragon was happy and joined his friends. They all danced and had fun. No one laughed at him, and he did not embarrass himself. The curious little dragon learned that it is okay to try new things with friends.
