Ben and Lily were playing in the living room. They had many toys and books to have fun with. But Ben wanted to play with water. He took a big cup and filled it with water from the kitchen. He ran back to the living room and said to Lily, "Look, I have water! Let's splash!"
Lily did not want to splash. She liked to read books and look at pictures. She was sitting by the bookcase and holding a book. She said to Ben, "No, Ben, don't splash! You will make a mess and wet the books. Books don't like water. Put the cup down and read with me."
Ben did not listen to Lily. He thought splashing was more fun than reading. He said to Lily, "Splash, splash, splash!" and threw the water at her. Lily screamed and dropped the book. The water splashed on her, on the book, and on the bookcase. Some books fell down and got wet too.
Lily was very angry and sad. She cried and said to Ben, "You are mean, Ben! You ruined my book and the bookcase. You are not my friend anymore. Go away!"
Ben felt sorry and scared. He did not mean to make Lily cry. He wanted to play with her, not hurt her. He said to Lily, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was just playing. Please don't be mad at me. Can we still be friends?"
But Lily did not answer him. She ran to their dad, who was bald and had glasses. She told him what Ben did and showed him the wet book and the bookcase. Dad was not happy. He looked at Ben and said, "Ben, what did you do? You know you are not supposed to play with water in the living room. You have to clean up the mess and apologize to Lily. And no more splashing, or you will be in trouble."
