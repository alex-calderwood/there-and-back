Once upon a time there was a little girl named Denise. She was three years old and had curly hair. Denise loved to play outside and was always ready for fun. 
One day, Denise's mom warned her not to play near the river. She said, "Denise, it's not safe to play near the water. So stay away, okay?" 
Denise took her mom's advice and found a spot in the grass. She played with a doll and made flowers out of sticks. After a while, she noticed a bright red balloon in the grass. Curiously, she reached for the balloon. As soon as she touched the balloon, it flew up into the sky. 
"Denise, you spoilt your hair!" her mother scolded her. From then on, Denise made sure to stay safe and always followed her mom's advice. 
The End.
