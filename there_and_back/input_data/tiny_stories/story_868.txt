Once upon a time there was a nice bear. One day the bear decided to go for a walk in the forest. He wore his nicest suit for the occasion. As he was walking, he heard another bear shouting in the distance.
So the nice bear decided to investigate and he quickly found the other bear. The other bear was crying and throwing his suit on the ground. The nice bear asked the other bear why he was so upset.
The other bear said he had quit his job as a forest guide and he was feeling sad about it. The nice bear said that he was sorry and then encouraged the other bear to not give up. 
The nice bear reminded the other bear that there were lots of nice things to do in the forest, like fishing and bird watching. He suggested that the other bear stay and explore the forest instead of giving up. 
The other bear smiled. He put on his suit, thanked the nice bear and decided to stay in the forest and look for adventures.
