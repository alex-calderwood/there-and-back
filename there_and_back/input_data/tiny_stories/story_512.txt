Yesterday, Max saw a cheap toy. He was so excited that he shouted, "Mama, do I have enough money to buy this toy?" Mama said, "Yes, if it's cheap enough, you can get it." So Max ran to the cashier and proudly said, "I want this toy, please." The cashier smiled and said, "That will be five dollars." Max quickly dug in his pocket and handed over five dollars. He was so happy that he ran back home with the toy and showed it to his mama. Happy with his purchase, Max spent the rest of the day playing with the toy.
