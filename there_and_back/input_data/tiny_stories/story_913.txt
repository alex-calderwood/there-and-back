One day, a nice crane was near the water. It liked to move its long neck to catch fish. The nice crane had a friend, a small frog. They liked to play together.
The frog said, "Let's play a game! You move your neck and try to catch me!" The nice crane agreed and they started to play. The frog jumped and the crane moved its neck, but the frog was too fast.
Suddenly, a big wind came and moved the frog far away. The nice crane was scared. It moved its neck fast to catch the frog. The frog was safe in the crane's beak.
"Thank you for saving me!" said the frog. The nice crane was happy to help. They continued to play and be best friends.
