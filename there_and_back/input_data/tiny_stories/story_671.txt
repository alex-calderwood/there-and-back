Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a big orange cat. The cat had a toy called a laser. The laser made a little red dot that the cat liked to chase.
One day, the cat saw the red dot on a tree. The cat climbed the tree to catch the dot. But the cat got stuck in the tree and could not get down. The cat was sad and scared.
A kind boy saw the cat in the tree. He wanted to help and save the cat. The boy got a long stick and used it to help the cat come down. The cat was happy and thanked the boy. They played with the laser and became good friends.
