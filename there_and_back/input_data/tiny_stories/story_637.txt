One day, a little fish named Fin was swimming in the sea. He loved to swim all day long. Fin had a friend named Tom, who was a tiny crab. They liked to play together near the shore.
One day, while they were playing, a big shark came. The shark wanted to eat Fin and Tom. Fin and Tom were scared. Fin said, "We need to stop the shark!" Tom said, "Yes, we need to stop him or we will be eaten!"
Fin and Tom tried to stop the shark. They swam as fast as they could, but the shark was too big and too strong. They were not lucky that day. The shark caught them, and Fin and Tom were no more.
