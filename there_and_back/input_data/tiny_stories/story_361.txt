Once upon a time, there was a little dog with soft fur. He loved to jump and play all day. His name was Buddy.
One day, Buddy saw a ball stuck high in a tree. His friend, a small bird, wanted the ball back. Buddy wanted to be useful and help his friend. He thought, "I will jump and get the ball."
Buddy jumped and jumped. He tried very hard. Finally, he jumped so high that he got the ball. The bird was very happy. Buddy was a useful friend. They played with the ball all day and had lots of fun.
