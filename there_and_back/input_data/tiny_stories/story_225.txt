Once upon a time, there was a big park. In the park, there was a girl named Lucy. Lucy loved to play in the park every day. She would swing, slide, and run with her friends. The park was her favorite place.
One day, the sun was very harsh. It was hot, and Lucy was tired. She sat under a tree to rest. As she sat there, she had a memory. She remembered her first time at the park. She was very little, and her mom held her hand as they walked.
Lucy smiled at her memory. She knew that the park was special to her. Even when the sun was harsh, she still loved to be there. The park was her happy place, and she would always remember it.
