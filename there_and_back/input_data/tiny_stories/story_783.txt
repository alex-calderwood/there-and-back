Once upon a time, there was a powerful bird. The bird had big wings and could fly very high in the sky. The bird had many friends, but one day, it decided to leave them all and go on a long trip.
The bird flew and flew, higher and higher in the sky. It saw many new things, like big trees, pretty flowers, and other animals. But the bird started to miss its friends. It felt sad and alone.
The powerful bird tried to fly back to its friends, but it was too late. It had gone too far away and got lost. The bird could not find its way back home, and it stayed lost in the sky. The bird was very sad, and its friends missed it too.
