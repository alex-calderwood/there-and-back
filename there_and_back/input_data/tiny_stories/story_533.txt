Once upon a time, there was a powerful dog named Max. He was big and strong. Max lived in a little house with his friend, a small cat named Lily.
One day, Max and Lily found a case. The case was blue and pretty. They did not know what was inside. Max tried to open it, but it was hard.
Lily had an idea. She mentioned to Max, "Let's ask for help." They went to their friend, a smart bird named Sky. Sky helped them open the case. Inside, they found fun toys to play with. They were all very happy and played together all day.
