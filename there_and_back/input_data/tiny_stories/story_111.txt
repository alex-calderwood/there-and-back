Once upon a time there was a little girl named Rose. Rose was confused because she couldn't find her favorite toy. She looked everywhere but couldn't find it.
Rose asked her mom for help. Mom smiled, went to the kitchen, and came back with a big box. Inside the box, Rose found her toy with a label.
Mom and Rose sat down together. Mom showed Rose how to fold the label, but Rose was still confused. She didn't know how to fold it.
But then mom explained that it was easy and showed Rose how to do it. Once she understood, Rose was able to fold the label perfectly.
Rose was relieved and happy. Now, with the neatly folded label, she could easily find her favorite toy any time.
