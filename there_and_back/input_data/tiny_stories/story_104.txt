One day, a boy went for a walk. He saw a big, green dragon. The dragon was not normal. The boy was not scared. He wanted to observe the dragon.
The dragon said, "Hi, I am a nice dragon. Do you want to be friends?" The boy said, "Yes, I want to be friends. I like dragons."
They played all day. The boy and the dragon were happy. They were good friends. The boy went home and told his mom about the dragon. His mom smiled and said, "That sounds like a fun day."
