Once upon a time, there was a pink dish that belonged to a little girl named Sarah. She loved to play with the dish and often pretended to feed her toys with it.
One day, Sarah's mom noticed how much Sarah liked playing with the pink dish. She decided to give Sarah a special treat and let her take the dish with her to the park.
When Sarah arrived at the park with her dish, she couldn't stop smiling. She played with the dish in the sand, and she filled it with stones and leaves she had found.
But then, Sarah noticed that she couldn't find the dish. She started to worry, and she began to look around but still couldn't spot her pink dish.
Suddenly, Sarah heard someone call her name. She looked up and saw her dad with the pink dish. He said to her “I found your dish by the slide. I knew it was yours because of the color.” Sarah hugged the dish to her chest and gave her dad a big smile.
Just then, Sarah's mom walked up and asked Sarah why she was so worried about her dish. Sarah smiled at her mom and said “I wasn't worried, I was just looking for it!”
