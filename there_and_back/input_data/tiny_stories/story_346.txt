Once upon a time there was a little boy who wanted to fly a rocket. He loved rockets and wanted to ride in one. He asked his mom if he could go and fly one.
"No," his mom said. "That would be too dangerous for you. We have to prevent you from getting hurt."
The little boy was sad. He looked out the window and saw a man flying in a rocket. He really wanted to do it too. 
But then, he had an idea. He asked his mom if he could ride in a busy rocket.
"No," she said, shaking her head. "That's too dangerous. We must prevent you from getting hurt. We will look for a safer way for you to fly." 
The little boy was disappointed, but he understood. His mom promised to find a different way for him to go flying and he was excited to find out what it was. Together, they found a way for the little boy to fly that was fun and didn't put him in danger.
