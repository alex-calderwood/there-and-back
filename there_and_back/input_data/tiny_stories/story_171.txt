Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tom. Tom had a toy alarm. He loved his alarm very much. One day, Tom was playing with his alarm near a big tree.
While playing, Tom saw a small bird. The bird looked hurt. Tom wanted to help the bird. He picked up the bird and took it to his mom. His mom helped the bird become well again.
Tom felt happy to help the bird. The bird flew away and Tom went back to playing with his alarm. The moral of the story is to always help others when they are hurt.
