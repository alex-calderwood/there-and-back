Once upon a time, there was a little blue desk. The desk lived in a room with a big window. The sun would shine through the window and make the desk feel warm and happy. The desk loved to be in the sun.
One day, a little girl named Sally came into the room. She saw the blue desk and said, "Oh, what a pretty desk! I love it!" Sally sat down at the desk and started to draw pictures. She drew a cat, a dog, and a big tree. The desk loved to help Sally draw.
Sally came back to the blue desk every day to draw more pictures. One day, Sally drew a picture of the blue desk and said, "This is for you, my lovely desk." The blue desk felt so happy and loved. They were best friends forever.
