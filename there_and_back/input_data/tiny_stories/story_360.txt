Daniel was 3 years old. He was very curious about the night sky. Every night, he would look up and observe the stars and comets that passed by. One evening, he saw something very special - a modern comet. He asked his mom, "What is that?" She laughed and said, "That is a modern comet. It's like a shooting star."
Daniel was mesmerised. But his mom couldn't ignore his excitement for long. She said, "It's time for bed. You can watch it again tomorrow night."
The next night, Daniel went back outside and looked for the comet. He searched the night sky and found it! He was excited, but he wanted to share it with his mom. He called out to her, but no one answered. He called louder, "Mom, look! The modern comet!" But his mom had gone inside and ignored him.
Daniel waited patiently for his mom to come back outside, but she didn't. He waited until morning. He was disappointed, but he knew he would see the comet again. He promised himself that he would wait for his mom to come outside and show her the modern comet, so that they could enjoy it together.
