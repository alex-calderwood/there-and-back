Once there was a famous train. It was so famous that everyone wanted to ride it, but it was too expensive.
"Can I ride the famous train?" asked the boy.
"No, it's too expensive," replied the father.
The boy was very sad. But then one day, the father announced he'd found a way they could ride the train.
"I've found a way to gain access to the famous train," he said.
And that's exactly what they did. They rode on the famous train and it was so much fun. Everyone waved as they passed them by. The boy was so happy.
He had gained access to the famous train and now it was his favorite thing to do. Every day he would run to the station and wait for the train and always have the best time. He had gained access to his very own special train.
