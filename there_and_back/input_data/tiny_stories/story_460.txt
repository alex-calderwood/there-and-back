Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a delicate napkin. It was very pretty and lived with a girl named Lily. Lily loved the napkin and used it every day at lunchtime.
One sunny day, Lily saw ants marching in a line. They wanted to take her food. "Oh no!" said Lily. "You can't have my food!" But the ants did not listen. They kept marching towards her food.
Lily had an idea. She took the delicate napkin and waved it at the ants. "Shoo, ants, shoo!" she said. The ants stopped marching and went away. Lily was happy and thanked the napkin. From that day on, they became best friends and always had lunch together.
