Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She loved to put on shows for her family. One day, she decided to put on an amazing show called "opera". Mia told her family to sit and watch her sing and dance.
As Mia started her opera, something unexpected happened. A little bird flew into her room! Mia stopped singing and looked at the bird. The bird looked back at her and started to sing too! Mia and the bird sang together, and it was the most amazing sound.
The family clapped and cheered for Mia and the little bird. They were so happy that the bird had joined their show. From that day on, Mia and the bird became best friends. They put on many more amazing operas for everyone to enjoy.
