Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a cute dog named Max. Max loved to play with his toys and chew on them all day long. One day, Max saw a tie hanging from a chair. It was a new toy for him to play with! He was very happy and started to chew on the tie. 
Max's owner, a little boy named Tim, saw Max chewing on the tie. "Oh no, Max!" he said, "That's Dad's tie for work! We need to find you a new toy." Tim and Max went outside to look for a new toy for Max to chew on. They looked under the tree, by the flowers, and near the fence.
As they were looking, they found a big box. Tim opened the box and saw many colorful ties inside. They were not just any ties, but special ties made just for dogs to chew on! Max was so excited and picked out his favorite tie. Tim said, "Now you have your own tie to chew on, Max!" And Max chewed on his new tie happily ever after.
