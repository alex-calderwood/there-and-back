One day, a gray bunny named Bob was playing in the forest. He saw a big tree and wanted to peek behind it. As he got closer, he saw something shiny on the ground. It was a small arrow. Bob picked it up and wondered who it belonged to.
In the forest, there was a boy named Tim. He was looking for his lost arrow. "Where is my arrow?" Tim asked out loud. Bob heard Tim and hopped over to him with the arrow. "I found your arrow!" said Bob, giving it back to Tim. Tim was happy and thanked Bob for his help.
But then, a big, mean wolf came into the forest. He wanted the arrow too! Tim and Bob were scared, but they knew they had to work together to stop the wolf. They made a plan: Tim would shoot the arrow at a tree branch, and Bob would make a loud noise to scare the wolf away. The plan worked! The wolf ran away, and Tim and Bob were safe. They became best friends and played together in the forest every day.
