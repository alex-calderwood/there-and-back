Once upon a time, there were two best friends named Jane and Joe. Jane wanted to make everyone happy so she decided to choose a special place for all of her friends to go. She chose a fountain in the center of town.
The fountain was popular with the locals so Jane was excited. She knew everyone would enjoy it. She asked Joe to come too.
When they arrived, everyone was so impressed by the fountain. It was tall and sparkly. They had never seen anything like it before!
Joe was amazed. He said to Jane, "This is the best place ever. We should come here all the time!" Jane smiled and agreed.
They all enjoyed the fountain together, laughing and splashing in the water. Even though they were all very different, they had chosen the perfect place to make wonderful memories together.
