One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw a big red ball and he wanted to play with it. Tim asked his mom if he could have the ball. His mom said, "You can request to borrow the ball from the girl who owns it."
Tim went to the girl and said, "Can I play with your ball, please?" The girl was not nice and said, "No, it's mine!" Tim was sad, but he didn't give up. He tried to be her friend and asked her again. This time, she said yes. Tim was very happy and thought he had success.
But, the girl was terrible at sharing. She took the ball away from Tim while they were playing. Tim got mad and they both started to fight. Their moms came and took them home. They did not play together again. The moral of the story is to always be kind and share, so everyone can have fun.
