Once upon a time, there was a farmer, who was out for a drive in his tractor. As he drove, it began to rain heavily and the farmer was soon wet. He stopped his tractor and began to grumble. 
"Ah, what a wet day," he said. "Time to go home." 
Just then, the farmer heard something. He got out of his tractor and peered into the distance. He saw a small ewe, shaking from the cold and rain. 
"Why, you look very wet!" the farmer said, and he realised that the ewe must have been separated from it's flock. 
The farmer decided he had to raise the animal back to safety. So he put the ewe in his cart and drove back to his farm. 
Once there, he sheltered the ewe in his barn and looked after it until it was warm, safe and dry.
The farmer was happy that he had been able to raise the ewe from danger and so the ewe and the farmer lived happily ever after.
