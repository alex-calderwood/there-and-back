Once upon a time, there was a purple cat named Mark. Mark was not like other cats, because he was purple. He lived in a little house with his friend, a girl named Sue.
One day, Sue said to Mark, "Let's keep a box of our favorite toys!" Mark liked this idea. They found a big box and put their toys inside. They had fun playing with their toys together.
One day, while playing, Mark's toy got lost. Mark was sad. Sue said, "Don't worry, Mark. We will find your toy." They looked and looked, and finally found the toy under the bed. Mark was happy again. They kept playing and had a great day.
