Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with maps. They had a big map of the world on their wall, and they would point to different countries and pretend to go there. One day, they decided to play a game. They would spin a bottle on the map, and wherever it stopped, they would learn something about that country.
"Let's go, Ben!" Lily said, as she spun the bottle. The bottle turned and turned, and then stopped on a small island. "Look, it's Iceland! That's an unusual country. Do you know why?"
Ben shook his head. He did not know much about Iceland.
"Because it has ice and fire!" Lily said. "It's very cold there, and there are big mountains of ice. But there are also hot springs and volcanoes that make fire and smoke. Isn't that cool?"
Ben nodded. He thought that was cool. He wanted to see ice and fire.
"Maybe we can go there someday," Lily said. "But first, let's spin the bottle again. Maybe we'll find another unusual country."
They spun the bottle again, and waited to see where it would turn. They hoped it would be somewhere fun and interesting. They loved to learn about the world.
