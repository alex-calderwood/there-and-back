One day, a big dog named Max went for a walk. He saw a small hill and thought it would be fun to run up and down. Max felt happy when he played on the hill.
Max saw a little bird named Tim on top of the hill. Tim looked very tired and let out a big yawn. Max asked, "Why are you so tired, Tim?" Tim said, "I did a foolish thing. I stayed up all night playing and now I am very sleepy."
Max felt sorry for Tim and said, "Next time, go to sleep early, so you won't be tired." Tim nodded and said, "You are right, Max. I will go to sleep early tonight." They both played on the hill for a while, then Tim flew home to take a nap. Max continued to play on the hill, feeling happy that he helped his friend.
