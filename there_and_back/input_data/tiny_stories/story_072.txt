Once upon a time, there was a little cat named Kitty. Kitty was envious of her friend, a big dog named Doggy, because he could run very fast. One day, they went to a party with their friends.
At the party, there was a magic show. The magician had a napkin in his hand. He showed the napkin to everyone and then said a magic word. Then, he revealed a big cake from under the napkin. All the friends clapped and cheered.
Kitty and Doggy went to eat the cake. But, something unexpected happened. The cake started to shake and then it changed into a pair of fast shoes for Kitty. Now, Kitty could run as fast as Doggy. They both laughed and played together, running fast and having fun at the party.
