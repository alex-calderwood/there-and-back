Once upon a time, there was a huge dog named Max. Max loved to watch cartoons on TV. One day, Max saw a little girl named Lily watching cartoons too. They both liked the same cartoon.
Max said to Lily, "I like this cartoon. Do you like it too?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, I love it! Let's watch it together." So, Max and Lily sat down and watched the cartoon together. They laughed and had fun.
But then, the TV stopped working. Max and Lily started to complain. "Oh no! What happened to the cartoon?" they said. Max's mom came in and saw the sad faces. She fixed the TV and the cartoon came back on. Max and Lily were happy again and continued to watch their favorite cartoon.
