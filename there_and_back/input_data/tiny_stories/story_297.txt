Once upon a time, there was a patient cat named Blink. Blink loved to play with clothes. Every day, he would find clothes to play with in the house.
One day, Blink found a big pile of clothes. He jumped in and started to play. Blink would hide under the clothes and then jump out. He had so much fun.
Soon, Blink's friends came to play with him. They all had fun playing in the clothes. They played hide and seek and tag. At the end of the day, they were tired but happy. And that's how Blink and his friends had a fun day playing with clothes.
