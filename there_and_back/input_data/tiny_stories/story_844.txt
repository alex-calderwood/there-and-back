Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim liked to watch things. He liked to watch cars go fast on the street. He liked to watch birds fly in the sky. Tim also liked shapes, and his favorite shape was a triangle.
One sunny day, Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw a big, red triangle on the playground. Tim was very happy. He ran fast to the triangle and started to play with it. He climbed on the triangle and pretended it was a big mountain.
As Tim played on the triangle, he saw a fast squirrel running in the park. Tim stopped and watched the squirrel. The squirrel ran up a tree and jumped from branch to branch. Tim laughed and clapped his hands. He loved watching the fast squirrel. Tim had a fun day at the park with his mom, playing on the triangle and watching the fast squirrel.
