Once upon a time, there was a painter named Tom. Tom loved to paint incredible pictures with many colors. He painted trees, flowers, and animals. Everyone in the town liked Tom's paintings.
One day, Tom was painting a big, beautiful rainbow. He was very happy. But then, he ran out of his favorite color, blue. Tom started to frown. He needed blue to finish his rainbow.
Tom went to the store to buy more blue paint. When he got back, he started painting again. He smiled as he finished his rainbow. Everyone in the town came to see Tom's incredible rainbow. They all clapped and cheered. Tom was happy again, and his frown was gone.
