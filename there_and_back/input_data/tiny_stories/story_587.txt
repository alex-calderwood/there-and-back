Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big hill covered with white ice. They wanted to slide down the hill and have fun.
They found a big round thing that looked like a ball. It was made of ice too. They thought it would be fun to roll it down the hill. They pushed and pushed until the ice ball was at the top of the hill.
But when they let go of the ice ball, it did not roll down the hill. It stayed still. Lily and Ben were confused. Why did the ice ball not move? They tried to push it again, but it was too heavy.
Then they heard a voice. It was their dad. He came to see what they were doing. He saw the ice ball and smiled. He said, "That is not a ball, that is a snowman. Someone made it with snow and ice and gave it a hat and a scarf. It is not meant to roll, it is meant to stay and look nice."
Lily and Ben looked at the ice ball again. They saw the hat and the scarf and the eyes and the nose. They realized it was a snowman. They felt sorry for trying to roll it. They said, "We are sorry, snowman. We did not know you were a snowman. We thought you were a ball. We will not try to roll you again."
Their dad said, "That is okay. You did not mean to hurt the snowman. You were just curious and wanted to have fun. But next time, you should look carefully before you touch something. You might break it or make it sad. And you should always ask before you borrow something. Maybe the snowman belongs to someone else who loves it."
Lily and Ben nodded. They learned their lesson. They said, "Thank you, dad. We will look and ask before we touch. We will be more careful and respectful." They gave their dad a hug and said goodbye to the snowman. They went to find another way to have fun on the hill.
