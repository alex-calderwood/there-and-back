Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to skip and play with her friends. One day, Lily and her friends were playing near a big, rough tree. The tree was very old and had lots of bumps on it.
Lily's teacher came to talk to them. She said, "Tomorrow, we will have an exam. You need to learn your colors and numbers." Lily and her friends were scared, but they knew they had to do well on the exam.
That night, Lily and her friends practiced their colors and numbers. The next day, they all went to school and took the exam. When they got their exams back, they saw that they had all done a great job. Lily and her friends were so happy, they skipped all the way home.
