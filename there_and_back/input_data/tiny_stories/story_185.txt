Once there was a little girl named Millie. She was very nervous because she had to finish cleaning her carpet. She had spent all morning scrubbing, and was hoping that it would be ready soon.
Millie's mom came into the room and said, "Finished yet, Millie?"
Millie nodded eagerly and said, "Almost done!" 
Mom smiled and said, "Good job!" 
Millie smiled too and gave the carpet one last scrub. Then she stood back and stared proudly at her clean carpet. It looked like new.
Mom said, "Wow! You did a great job. You should be very proud."
Millie beamed and felt less nervous. She had finished her carpet and it looked so nice.
