One day, a cat named Tom was very tired. He lay down on a soft bed to take a nap. As he slept, his friend, a dog named Max, came to play.
Max saw a newspaper on the floor. He picked it up with his mouth and shook it. The newspaper made a loud noise that woke Tom up. Tom was not happy. He said, "Max, I am tired. Please be quiet."
Max felt bad and said, "I am sorry, Tom." Just then, Max had to sneeze. He tried to hold it in, but he could not. "Achoo!" Max sneezed very loud. Tom woke up again and looked at Max. They both started to laugh. Tom said, "It's okay, Max. Let's play together now." And they played happily all day.
