One day, a delicate little bird was very tired. She needed to take a nap. She flew around and found a big mailbox. "This looks like a good place to nap," she said to herself. So, she went inside the mailbox and fell asleep.
After a while, a boy named Tom came to get his mail. He opened the mailbox and saw the bird. "Hello, little bird," he said. "Are you okay?" The bird woke up and said, "Yes, I was just taking a nap. Thank you for waking me up."
Just then, the mailbox started to shake. It was not a mailbox at all! It was a big robot! The robot stood up and said, "Hello, I am Mailbot. I was also taking a nap. Thank you for waking me up too!" Tom and the bird laughed and became friends with Mailbot. They all played together and had lots of fun.
