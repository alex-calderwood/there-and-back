Once upon a time, in the hot summer, there was a famous cat named Tom. Tom liked to play with his ball. One day, Tom went to the park to play with his friend, a dog named Max.
"Hi Max, let's play with my ball!" said Tom. Max was happy and they played together. They threw the ball and ran after it. Tom would drop the ball and Max would pick it up.
Suddenly, while they were playing, the ball went very high and got stuck in a tree! Tom and Max looked up at the ball and didn't know what to do. They tried to jump and get the ball, but they couldn't reach it.
A little bird saw them and wanted to help. The bird flew up to the tree and pushed the ball with its beak. The ball fell down and Tom and Max were very happy. They thanked the little bird and continued to play together. The bird became their new friend and they all played together all summer long.
