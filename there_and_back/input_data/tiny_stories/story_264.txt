One day, Mommy and Sam were looking at Sam's x-ray. Sam had hurt his arm, and the doctor wanted to make sure it was okay. The x-ray showed that Sam's arm was fine, but the doctor said something wrong with it. Sam started to cry. 
Mommy said, "It's okay, Sam. The doctor is just being very careful. He just wants you to feel better."
Sam said, "But he said something was wrong."
Mommy said, "He was a bit careless. But what we can do is have the x-ray done again and make sure it's okay."
Sam said, "Okay. I don't want to miss my arm."
Mommy hugged him and kissed his forehead. She said, "That's never going to happen. I'm always here to help you if you ever miss anything."
