Once upon a time, in a big tree, there was a small bird with a hurt wing. The bird could not fly very well. One day, a gentle wind blew and the bird tried to fly. But the bird fell down.
A kind girl saw the bird and wanted to help. She knew she had to remove something stuck on the bird's wing. She took the bird home and was very careful. She removed a small stick from the bird's wing. The bird felt better.
The next day, the bird tried to fly again. This time, the bird flew high up in the sky! The kind girl was so happy. She did not know that the bird was a magic bird. The bird thanked the girl and gave her a special gift. The girl could now talk to animals!
