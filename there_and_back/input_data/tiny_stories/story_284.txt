Once upon a time, there was a kind duck named Dara. Dara loved to swim in the big pond near her home. Every day, she would swim with her friends, the fish and the frogs.
One day, Dara's friend, Fred the Frog, said, "I miss swimming with you, Dara." Dara asked, "Why can't you swim with me today?" Fred said, "I hurt my leg, and it is hard to swim now."
Dara felt sad for her friend. She wanted to help Fred. So, she thought of a plan. Dara told her fish friends to swim near Fred and help him move in the water. With their help, Fred could swim again.
Fred was very happy and said, "Thank you, Dara, for being so kind." They all swam together, and they had a fun day in the big pond. From that day on, Dara, Fred, and the fish were always there for each other, and they never missed a day of swimming together.
