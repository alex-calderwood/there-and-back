Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man who had a big car. He loved to zoom fast in his car. One day, he saw a test on a paper. The test said, "Who can zoom the fastest?"
The wealthy man wanted to win the test. He got in his car and started to zoom. He went faster and faster. He passed trees, houses, and people. He was so happy to be going fast.
But then, something bad happened. The wealthy man zoomed too fast and hit a big tree. His car broke and he was sad. He did not win the test. The wealthy man learned that zooming too fast can be bad.
