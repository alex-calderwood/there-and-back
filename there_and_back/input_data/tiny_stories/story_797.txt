Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a vest that he loved very much. It was red and blue, and he wore it every day. All of Tim's friends were envious of his vest. They wanted one too.
One day, Tim and his friends went to play in the park. They played a game of hide and seek. Tim found a big tree and set behind it. He was very quiet and still, waiting for his friends to find him. But then, something unexpected happened.
A little dog came up to Tim and took his vest! Tim was very sad and ran after the dog. The dog ran and ran, but then it stopped and dropped the vest. Tim picked up his vest and saw that it was now green and yellow! The dog had some paint on its paws and had changed the color of Tim's vest. Tim's friends found him and they all laughed. Now, they were envious of his new green and yellow vest.
