Anna liked to write. She wrote stories with her crayons and paper. She wrote about her toys, her friends, and her dreams. She wrote every day, even when it was raining or dark.
One day, Anna and her family had to go on a trip. They packed their luggage with clothes, books, and snacks. Anna wanted to bring her crayons and paper, too. She put them in a small bag and put it in her luggage.
But when they got to the airport, something bad happened. The man at the counter said their luggage was too heavy. He said they had to take out some things or pay more money. Anna's mom and dad were frustrated. They opened their luggage and took out some clothes and books. They tried to close their luggage again, but it was still too heavy.
Anna saw her small bag with her crayons and paper. She knew they were not heavy, but she also knew they were not important. She loved to write, but she loved her mom and dad more. She took out her small bag and gave it to the man. She said, "You can have this. I don't need it."
The man smiled and thanked her. He said she was very kind and brave. He put her small bag in a big box with other things. He said they would go to other children who needed them. He said maybe they would write stories with her crayons and paper.
Anna felt sad, but also happy. She hugged her mom and dad and said, "I love you. Maybe I can write more stories when we come back." They hugged her back and said, "We love you, too. You are our best story." They boarded the plane and flew away. Anna looked out the window and imagined the stories she would write.
