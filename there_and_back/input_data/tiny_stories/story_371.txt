Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a pet dog named Max. One day, Amy and Max went for a walk in the park. They saw a big tree with a lot of fruit on it. Amy saw a fruit that looked weird. She picked it up and showed it to Max.
Amy had a question for Max. She asked, "Do you think this fruit is good to eat?" Max looked at the fruit and didn't know the answer. So, Amy decided to taste the fruit to find out. She took a small bite and made a funny face.
The fruit had a weird taste. Amy didn't like it. She said, "Yuck! I don't want to eat this fruit again!" Max barked and wagged his tail. They both laughed and continued their walk in the park. From that day, Amy learned that not all fruits taste good, even if they look interesting.
