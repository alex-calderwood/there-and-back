Tom and Lily went to the zoo with their mom. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and birds. They liked to watch them and learn their names.
When they came to the zebra area, they saw a big zebra with black and white stripes. But next to it, there was a small zebra with purple and white stripes. Tom and Lily were very surprised.
"Mom, look at that zebra!" Tom said. "It is purple! Why is it purple?"
Mom smiled and said, "That zebra is special. It was born with a different color. But it is still a zebra, and it has a family and friends."
Lily looked at the purple zebra and said, "It is pretty. Can we pet it?"
Mom said, "No, we can't pet it. It is not a toy. It is a wild animal. We have to respect it and keep a distance."
Tom and Lily nodded. They understood. They watched the purple zebra run and play with the other zebras. They saw that the other zebras accepted it and did not mind its color. They thought that was nice.
They learned a new word that day: accept. It means to like someone or something the way they are, even if they are different. Tom and Lily decided to accept everyone and everything, just like the zebras.
