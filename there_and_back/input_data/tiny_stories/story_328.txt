Once upon a time, there was a clever crab. The crab lived near the sea. One day, the crab found a big, shiny rock.
The clever crab wanted to show everyone the shiny rock. The crab took the rock to the other animals. The other animals were happy and they did applaud.
But then, something unexpected happened. The shiny rock changed! It turned into a big, pretty fish. The clever crab and the other animals were very surprised. They all became friends and played together. And they all lived happily ever after.
