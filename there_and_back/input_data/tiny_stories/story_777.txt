Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She had a red bicycle that she loved to ride. One sunny day, Lucy went for a ride on her bicycle to the busy park. She saw many kids playing and having fun.
While Lucy was playing, she forgot about her bicycle. A little boy named Tim saw the red bicycle and thought it was lost. So, he decided to return it to its owner. He walked around the busy park, asking kids if the bicycle was theirs.
Finally, Tim found Lucy and asked her if the red bicycle belonged to her. Lucy was so happy to see her bicycle again. She thanked Tim for returning it to her. From that day on, Lucy and Tim became good friends, and they always played together at the busy park.
