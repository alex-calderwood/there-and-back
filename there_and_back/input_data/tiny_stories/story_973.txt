Once upon a time, there lived a little boy named Billy. He liked going to the park and swinging on the swings. One day, Billy was at the park and he heard a noise. It was a big, bossy bird.
Billy watched as the big, bossy bird flapped it's wings and flew away. The bird dropped something on the ground. It was a dictionary! 
Billy was so excited. He wanted to find out what the dictionary said. But, it was too big for him to carry.
Billy asked his dad if he could borrow his dictionary. His dad said yes and helped him carry it back home. 
Once home, Billy pulled out the dictionary and opened it. He was so amazed at all the words inside! 
Billy took his dictionary to the park every day. He would try and remember all the words he read. Billy was so happy. He finally had a dictionary of his own.
