Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved eating yogurt. She ate yogurt every day. One day, her mommy told her, "Sue, we need to go to the store to buy yogurt. We are out of yogurt."
Sue was very excited to go to the store with her mommy. She knew that she would get her favorite yogurt. But Sue's mommy told her to be careful and not to drop the yogurt. Sue felt a little scared, but she wanted to show her mommy that she could do it.
At the store, Sue picked up the yogurt. She held it very tight. She did not want to drop it. But then, she saw her friend Tim. She waved to Tim and forgot to hold the yogurt tight. The yogurt fell on the floor. Sue felt very embarrassed. She did not want her mommy to be mad. But her mommy just smiled and said, "It's okay, Sue. We all make mistakes. What is important is that you value the yogurt and learn from this." Sue felt better and promised to be more careful next time.
