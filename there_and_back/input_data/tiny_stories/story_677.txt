One day, a little girl named Lucy went for a walk. She saw a big, attractive house. The house was red and pretty. Lucy wanted to see what was inside.
She knocked on the door, and a nice lady opened it. The lady said, "Hello, little girl. Would you like some sugar?" Lucy liked sugar, so she said, "Yes, please!" The lady gave her a big bag of sugar.
Lucy walked home with her sugar. She ate it all up. But then, her tummy hurt. She ate too much sugar. She felt sad and went to bed.
