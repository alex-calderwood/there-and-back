Once upon a time, there was an enormous tree. It had many big branches. A little bird lived in the tree. The bird had a friend, a small squirrel. They liked to play together.
One day, the bird said to the squirrel, "I have a fun game. Let's find numbers in the tree!" The squirrel was excited and asked, "How do we play?" The bird replied, "We look for things that look like numbers. The one who finds the most numbers wins!"
The bird and the squirrel started to search the tree. The bird found a branch that looked like the number 1. The squirrel found a leaf that looked like the number 3. They were having so much fun. They knew that there was a big surprise waiting for them at the end of the game.
Finally, they found all the numbers from 1 to 10. The big surprise was a big, yummy nut hidden in the tree. The squirrel was so happy and said, "Thank you, bird, for the fun game!" They shared the nut and continued to play together in the enormous tree.
