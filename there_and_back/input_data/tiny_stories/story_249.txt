Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. He liked the color blue. He wore blue clothes every day. Tom wanted to become a soldier when he grew up.
One day, Tom found a blue soldier toy in his room. He played with the toy all day. Tom and the blue soldier went on many fun adventures together. They fought bad guys and saved the day.
When Tom grew up, he became a brave soldier just like his blue toy. He helped people and made them happy. And every time he put on his blue uniform, he remembered his favorite blue soldier toy and the adventures they had together.
