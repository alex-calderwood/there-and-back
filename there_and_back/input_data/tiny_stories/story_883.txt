Once upon a time there was a little boy called Max. He lived in a big city, but he was very excited when he heard that it was snowsing. "Let's go outside and play in the snow!" said Max.
Max's mum smiled. "Ok, let's go!"
Max and his mum went outside and played in the lovely snow. Max built a big snowman and started to bury him. He filled the snowman with snow and smiled. He was very proud of his snowman.
Max's mum looked on and said, "I love your snowman, Max. It looks so lovely."
Max smiled and said, "Yes, I think so too. We should give him a name. How about Snowy?"
Max's mum agreed. "Snowy it is! Well done, Max! Let's go home now."
Max smiled and said goodbye to Snowy as he left with his mum. He couldn't wait to come back and play in the snow again!
