Once upon a time, in a safe and happy garden, there lived a little daisy. The daisy loved to play with her friends, the sun and the wind. They would dance and sing all day long.
One day, the sun suggested, "Let's play a new game today!" The daisy and the wind agreed. They played hide and seek. The sun would hide behind the clouds, and the daisy and the wind would try to find the sun.
The wind said to the daisy, "You look over there, and I will look over here." The daisy looked and looked but could not find the sun. The wind blew the clouds away, and the sun came out. They all laughed and played some more.
At the end of the day, the daisy felt tired but happy. She said, "Thank you, sun and wind, for playing with me today. I had so much fun!" The sun and the wind smiled and promised to play again soon. The little daisy felt safe and loved in her garden home.
