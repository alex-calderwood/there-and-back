Once upon a time, there was a little beetle who loved to dance. Every day, the beetle would dance under the big tree. The beetle was very independent and danced all by itself.
One day, while the beetle was dancing, a big wind came. The wind blew the beetle far away. The beetle landed in a new place with new bugs. The new bugs had never seen a beetle dance before.
The new bugs started to dance with the beetle. They all danced together and had so much fun. The beetle was not alone anymore. The beetle had found new friends to dance with, and they all danced happily ever after.
