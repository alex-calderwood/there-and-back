Bunny and Fox were friends who liked to play together. One day, they saw a big hill with many flowers and grass. They wanted to go there and have fun.
"Let's hop to the hill and see what we can find!" said Bunny.
"OK, but be careful. There might be traps or hunters," said Fox.
They hopped and hopped until they reached the hill. They saw many butterflies, bees, and birds. They also saw a big carrot and a big chicken.
"Wow, look at that carrot! It is so big and orange. I want to eat it!" said Bunny.
"Wow, look at that chicken! It is so big and juicy. I want to eat it!" said Fox.
They ran towards the carrot and the chicken, but they did not see the ropes and nets that were hidden in the grass. They were traps set by a farmer who wanted to catch them.
Suddenly, they felt something pull them and lift them up. They were caught in the traps and could not move.
"Help! Help! We are trapped!" they cried.
The farmer came and saw them. He smiled and said, "Ha! I got you, you naughty animals. You wanted to steal my carrot and my chicken, but now you are mine. I will take you home and make a stew out of you."
Bunny and Fox were very scared and sorry. They wished they had not been greedy and careless. They wished they had listened to Fox's warning.
They learned a hard lesson that day. They learned that it is not good to take what is not yours, and that it is important to be careful and watch out for dangers. They learned that play is fun, but hop is better.
