Once upon a time, there was a nice cat named Lily. Lily liked to dress up in pretty clothes every Sunday. She had a big hat with a bow on it.
One Sunday, Lily put on her hat and went for a walk. She saw her friend, a dog named Max. Max said, "Wow, Lily, you look nice!" Lily smiled and thanked Max.
They played together in the park all day. When it was time to go home, Lily and Max said goodbye. They had so much fun dressing up and playing on a nice Sunday.
