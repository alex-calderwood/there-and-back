Once upon a time, there was a big, tough dog named Max. Max loved to play and run all day long. He also liked to eat yummy food. One day, Max found a big, red ball in the park. He was so happy and played with it all day.
As the day was about to end, Max got hungry. He wanted to taste something yummy. He saw a big, juicy bone in the grass. He ran to it and took a bite. But the bone was not a bone at all! It was a big, brown rock!
Max was sad and surprised. He thought it was a yummy bone, but it was just a rock. He learned that sometimes things are not what they seem. Max went home and got a real tasty bone from his mom. He was happy again and played with his red ball until it was time for bed.
