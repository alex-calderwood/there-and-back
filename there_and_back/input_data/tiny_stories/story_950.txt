One day, a boy named Tim went outside to play. The sun was out, but it was mild. Tim saw snow on the ground. He wanted to play with the snow. He called his friend, Sam, to come and play too.
"Sam, come play in the snow with me!" Tim said. Sam came running, and they started to make a big snowball. They wanted to attach more snow to make it even bigger.
As they were attaching more snow, they found a big box under the snow. They were very surprised. "What is in the box?" Tim asked. Sam did not know. They opened the box together.
Inside the box, they found many fun toys! Tim and Sam were so happy. They played with the toys and forgot all about the snowball. The snow and the box made it a very special day for Tim and Sam.
