Once upon a time, there was a green frog named Tim. Tim liked to play dress-up with his friends. One day, he found a costume that made him look like a big, scary monster.
Tim wore the costume and went to play with his friends. When they saw him, they got scared and ran away. Tim laughed and said, "Don't be scared! It's just me, Tim!" But his friends did not believe him. They thought he was a real monster.
Tim felt sad and decided to surrender. He took off the costume and showed his friends it was just him. His friends felt bad for running away. They learned that they should not judge someone by how they look. Together, they played dress-up and had lots of fun.
