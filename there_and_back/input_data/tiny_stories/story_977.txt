As he walked, he saw a big fountain. The water in the fountain went up and down. Tim liked the big fountain a lot. He wanted to find something special in the park.
Tim walked around the big fountain and saw a shiny rock. He picked it up and smiled. Tim was happy to find something special by the big fountain. He took the shiny rock home to show his mom and dad. They all loved the special rock from the park.
