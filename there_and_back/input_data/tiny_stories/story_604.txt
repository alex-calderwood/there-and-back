Once upon a time, there was a little hanger who lived in a big closet. The hanger loved to swing back and forth all day. Every day, he would swing and play with his friends, the other hangers.
One day, a big storm came and shook the whole house. The little hanger was scared, but he was also very proud. He knew he had to be brave for his friends. So, he held on tight and didn't let go.
The storm went away, and the little hanger was still swinging. His friends were so happy that he stayed strong. They all played and swung together again, and the little hanger was very proud of himself.
