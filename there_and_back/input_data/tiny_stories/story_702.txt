Once upon a time, there was a weird fox. This fox had a big head and a small tail. It lived in a forest with many other animals.
One day, the weird fox wanted to play with the other animals. But the other animals did not want to play with the weird fox. They thought the fox was too different. So, they separate the weird fox from their games.
The weird fox was very sad. It did not understand why the other animals did not want to play. Then, a little bird saw the sad fox. The bird decided to be the fox's friend. They played together and had lots of fun. The other animals saw how happy they were and wanted to play too. In the end, all the animals played together and learned that being different is not bad.
