Once upon a time, there was a little bald boy named Tim. He liked to play in the park every day. One sunny day, while Tim was playing, a small green lizard appeared on the slide.
"Hi, I am Liz the Lizard," said the lizard. Tim was very happy to see the lizard. They played on the slide, the swings, and the seesaw. They had a lot of fun together.
At the end of the day, Tim said, "Liz, you are my best friend." Liz the Lizard smiled and said, "You are my best friend too, Tim." From that day on, Tim and Liz the Lizard played together in the park every day, and they were always happy.
