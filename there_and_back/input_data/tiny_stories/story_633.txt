Once upon a time, there was a little toy car named Zoomy. Zoomy was very fast and loved to race. But one day, Zoomy stopped moving. He needed a new battery.
Zoomy's friend, Tilly the teddy bear, saw him sad. Tilly said, "Zoomy, why are you sad?" Zoomy replied, "I need a new battery, so I can race again." Tilly wanted to help Zoomy, so they went on a journey to find a new battery.
On their way, they met a big, friendly dog named Barky. Barky had a delicious bone in his mouth. Tilly asked Barky, "Do you know where we can find a battery for Zoomy?" Barky wagged his tail and led them to a small shop.
Inside the shop, they found a nice man who gave them a battery. Zoomy was so happy! Zoomy said, "Thank you, Tilly and Barky! I love my new battery." Now, Zoomy could race again, and they all played together happily ever after.
