Once upon a time, there was a grumpy man who liked to sell mints. He had a small store where kids would come to buy them. The man was always sad and never smiled.
One day, a little girl came into the store. She wanted to buy some mints, but she did not have enough money. The grumpy man said no and sent her away. The little girl was sad, but she walked away.
The next day, the little girl came back with more money. She wanted to buy the mints again. But the grumpy man had raised the price. The little girl still did not have enough money. The grumpy man said no again and sent her away. The little girl was very sad and cried. The other kids saw this and decided they did not want to buy mints from the grumpy man anymore. His store became empty and he had no one to sell mints to. The grumpy man stayed sad and his store closed down.
