Sue had a friend named Tim. She asked him to play in her cardboard playhouse. Tim was happy, but he was too big for the playhouse. Tim tried to fit in, but he couldn't. He was sad.
Sue saw Tim was sad and wanted to help. She thought for a moment. Sue decided to make the playhouse bigger. They both worked hard to make it big enough for both of them. Sue was an honest friend who cared about Tim's feelings. They played together in the big playhouse and had a lot of fun.
