Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lisa. She loved to help her mom in the kitchen. One day, her mom asked her to display the clean pan on the table. Lisa was very happy to help.
Lisa picked up the clean pan and walked to the table. She put the pan on the table and smiled. She was proud of her work. But then, she saw a cat outside. She ran to the window to look at the cat.
While Lisa was looking at the cat, her baby brother crawled to the table. He saw the pan and pulled it down. The pan fell on the floor with a loud noise. Lisa's mom came running and saw the mess. She was sad and told Lisa to be more careful next time. The clean pan was not clean anymore, and the display was ruined.
