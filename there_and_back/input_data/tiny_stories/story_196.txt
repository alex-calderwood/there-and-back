Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a red bicycle. He loved to ride it every day. One day, Tim's mom said, "Do not go near the big road. It is dangerous." Tim said, "Okay, Mom."
The next day, Tim was riding his bicycle. He saw a big hill near the big road. Tim thought, "I want to go down the hill on my bicycle. It will be fun." He did not remember what his mom said. So, he went down the hill very fast.
As Tim went down the hill, he saw a big truck on the big road. He remembered what his mom said. "Dangerous!" Tim said. He stopped his bicycle just in time. Tim was safe. He spoke to himself, "I will listen to Mom next time."
