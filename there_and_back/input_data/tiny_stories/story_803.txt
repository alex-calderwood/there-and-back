Once upon a time, there was a little ghost. The ghost lived in an old house. The house was the original house in the town. The ghost liked the house because it was big and quiet.
One day, a family moved into the house. The ghost was scared, but it wanted to remain in the house. So, the ghost tried to be nice to the family. It did not make any loud noises or scary faces.
The family saw the ghost and thought it was cute. They let the ghost remain in the house. The ghost was happy to stay in the original house. The family and the ghost became good friends. They all lived happily ever after.
