Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to play with her toys. She was an independent girl who liked to do things on her own. One day, Sue had an idea. She wanted to sell some of her old toys to get new ones.
Sue took a big box and put all the toys she wanted to sell inside. She also found a drawer and put it next to the box. "I will use this drawer to keep the money I get from selling my toys," she said to herself.
The next day, Sue set up a small table outside her house. She put the box of toys on the table and the drawer next to it. Soon, her friend Tom came by. "What are you doing, Sue?" he asked. "I am selling my old toys to get new ones," she replied. Tom looked at the toys and picked one he liked. He gave Sue some money, and she put it in the drawer. They both smiled, happy with their trade. And that's how Sue learned to be even more independent and have fun while doing it.
