Once upon a time, there was a skeleton named Skelly. Skelly lived in a big, hard house made of rocks. He had many friends who would come and play with him.
One day, Skelly and his friends decided to make a big cake. They all worked together to mix the ingredients. Skelly said, "Let's make the biggest cake ever!" His friends agreed and they all laughed.
When the cake was ready, Skelly and his friends ate the cake together. They were very happy and full. After that, they played games until it was time to go home. Skelly waved goodbye to his friends and said, "Thank you for helping me make the cake!"
