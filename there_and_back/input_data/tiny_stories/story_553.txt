One day, a boy and a girl went to play in the park. They saw a weird fountain. The fountain had funny faces on it. The boy and girl laughed at the faces.
The boy said, "I want to touch the funny faces!" The girl said, "No, it's weird. Let's not touch it." But the boy did not listen. He demanded to touch the funny faces.
The boy touched the funny faces on the weird fountain. Suddenly, it started to rain. The rain did not stop. The boy and girl got very wet and had to go home. They were sad because their fun day at the park was ruined.
