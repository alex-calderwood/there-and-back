Once upon a time, there was a young bird named Tim. Tim lived in a tree with his mom and dad. Every day, Tim would look up at the sky and see the big birds flying high.
One day, Tim said, "I want to fly like the big birds!" His mom and dad told him he was too young and he needed to wait. But Tim did not want to wait, so he tried to fly by himself. He flapped his wings very hard, but he could not fly.
Tim felt sad and wanted to quit. His mom and dad saw him and said, "Don't quit, Tim. You will fly when you are bigger." Tim listened to his mom and dad and stopped trying to fly. He knew that one day, when he was bigger, he would fly high in the sky like the big birds.
