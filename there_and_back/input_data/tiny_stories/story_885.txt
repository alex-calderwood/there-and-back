Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim wanted to help his mom prepare dinner. His mom said, "If you help me, you will get a reward!"
Tim was very excited. He tried to lift a big pot, but it was too heavy for his weak arms. His mom saw him struggle and said, "Don't worry, Tim. You can help me by stirring the soup."
Tim stirred the soup with a big spoon. He felt very proud. When dinner was ready, his mom gave him a big piece of cake as his reward. Tim was so happy that he helped his mom and got a yummy treat.
