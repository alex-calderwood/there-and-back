Once upon a time, there was a jolly dog named Spot. Spot liked to play and run all day long. One day, Spot found a big place called a stadium. The stadium was very big and had lots of seats.
Spot wanted to study the stadium. He ran around, jumping up and down on the seats. He looked at the grass and the lines on the ground. Spot was very happy to learn about the stadium.
After Spot finished studying the stadium, he played with his ball. He ran and jumped and played until he was tired. Spot was so happy he found the big stadium. And from that day on, Spot went to the stadium to play and have fun every day.
