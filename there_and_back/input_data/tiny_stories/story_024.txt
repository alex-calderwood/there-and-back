One day, a little frog named Tim lived in a humble hut near a big pond. Tim loved to dive into the water and play with his friends. He would jump high, then dive deep into the pond. His friends would laugh and clap for him.
One day, while Tim was diving, he saw a big fish. The fish said, "Hi, I am Sam. Do you want to play with me?" Tim was scared, but he said, "Yes, let's play!" They played and had fun. Tim was happy that he met a new friend.
But then, something unexpected happened. Sam started to grow bigger and bigger! Tim was scared and asked, "Why are you so big now?" Sam laughed and said, "I am not a fish, I am a whale!" Tim was surprised but happy. Now, he had an even bigger friend to play and dive with in the pond.
