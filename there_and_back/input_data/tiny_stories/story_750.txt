Once upon a time, there was a busy pig. He liked to cook. One day, he was cooking in his little house. He was making a big pot of soup. He was very happy.
A little bird came to the window and said, "Hello, pig! What are you doing?" The pig said, "I am cooking soup. I am very busy." The bird said, "Can I help you?" The pig said, "Yes, you can help me find some more food."
The bird flew away to find food. But when he came back, he saw a big surprise! The soup was gone! The pig was sad. "Where did my soup go?" he asked. The bird said, "I don't know, but we can make more soup together." So they did.
The pig and the bird made a new pot of soup. They were very busy, but they were also very happy. They found out that they were good friends. And from that day on, they cooked together every day.
