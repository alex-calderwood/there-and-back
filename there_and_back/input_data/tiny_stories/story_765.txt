Once upon a time, there was a loyal dog named Max. Max had a best friend, a boy named Tim. They liked to play with Tim's toy motorcycle. They had a lot of fun together.
One day, while they were playing, the toy motorcycle broke. Tim was sad and Max was sad too. They did not know what to do. Max wanted to help Tim feel better.
Max said, "Don't worry, Tim. We will find a way to fix the motorcycle." They looked around and found some glue. They used the glue to fix the motorcycle. It took some time, but they made it happen. Tim was happy and Max was happy too.
In the end, Max and Tim played with the fixed motorcycle. They had fun again. Tim was glad that Max was his loyal friend. They knew they could always help each other when something bad happened.
