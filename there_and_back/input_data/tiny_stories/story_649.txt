Anna liked to help her mom in the garden. She liked to see the flowers and smell the herbs. Her mom showed her how to pick some herbs and put them in a basket. Anna picked some mint, some rosemary and some basil. She liked how they smelled.
When they went back to the house, her mom said they had to wash the herbs before they could use them. She filled a big bowl with water and gave Anna a small bowl. She told Anna to put some herbs in her bowl and wash them with her hands. Anna did as her mom said. She washed the mint, the rosemary and the basil. She liked how the water felt on her hands.
But then she saw something unusual in her bowl. It was a small green caterpillar. It was crawling on a basil leaf. Anna was surprised and curious. She picked up the leaf and looked at the caterpillar. It had tiny legs and a fuzzy body. It looked at her with its black eyes.
"Mom, look what I found!" Anna said, holding up the leaf. "It's a caterpillar!"
Her mom came over and smiled. She said it was a special kind of caterpillar that liked to eat basil. She said it would turn into a butterfly someday. She said they could keep it as a pet if Anna wanted.
Anna was happy. She said yes, she wanted to keep the caterpillar. She named it Basil. She put it in a jar with some basil leaves and some holes in the lid. She said she would take good care of it and watch it grow. She hoped it would become a beautiful butterfly. She thanked her mom for the unusual gift. She said she loved her and the herbs and Basil.
