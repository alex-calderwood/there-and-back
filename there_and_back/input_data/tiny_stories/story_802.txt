One day, a little girl named Sally was looking for her black hat. She wanted to wear it to the park. She looked everywhere but could not find it. She asked her mom, "Mom, do you remember where my black hat is?"
Her mom thought for a moment and said, "I think it is in the drawer in your room." Sally ran to her room and opened the drawer. There it was, her black hat!
Sally put on her hat and went to the park with her mom. They had a lot of fun playing on the swings and slides. Sally was happy she found her black hat. She remembered to put it back in the drawer when they got home, so she would not lose it again.
