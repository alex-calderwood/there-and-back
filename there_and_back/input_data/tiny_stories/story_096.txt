Once upon a time, there was a powerful girl named Lily. She had a swing in her backyard. Lily loved to play on her swing every day.
One sunny day, Lily's friend Tom came over. Tom saw the swing and said, "Wow, you own a swing! Can I play on it too?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, we can play together!"
Lily and Tom took turns on the swing. They laughed and had lots of fun. They felt like they could touch the sky. At the end of the day, they were very happy. And from that day on, they played on the swing together every day.
