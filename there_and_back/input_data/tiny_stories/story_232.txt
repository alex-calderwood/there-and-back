One day, a little bird with adorable wings wanted to soar high in the sky. It tried and tried, but its wings were too small. The bird was sad and sat on a tree branch.
A big bird saw the little bird and asked, "Why are you sad?" The little bird said, "I want to soar high, but my wings are too small." The big bird thought for a moment and said, "I have an idea! Hold on to my legs, and I will help you soar high."
The little bird held on to the big bird's knee and together they soared high in the sky. The little bird was so happy! But then, they saw a mean cat who wanted to catch them. The big bird flew faster and the cat could not catch them.
In the end, the little bird and the big bird became friends. They soared high in the sky every day and had lots of fun together. The mean cat never bothered them again.
