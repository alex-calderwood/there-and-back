Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She had a pretty blouse that she loved to wear. One day, Sally felt uncomfortable in her blouse. It was too tight on her. She asked her mom for help.
"Mom, can you please remove my blouse? It is uncomfortable," Sally said. Her mom agreed and helped her take off the blouse.
Sally went to play outside without her blouse. She was happy at first, but then the sun became very hot. She started to feel too warm and her skin turned red. Sally ran back inside and cried.
In the end, Sally learned that it is important to wear the right clothes for the weather. She was sad that she got a sunburn, and she wished she had listened to her mom.
