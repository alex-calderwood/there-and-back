One day, a little girl named Sue found a coat in her room. She did not know whose coat it was. Sue wanted to ask her mom to explain where it came from. She put on the coat and went to find her mom.
Sue found her mom in the kitchen. Her mom saw the coat and said, "Oh, that coat makes you look weak. It is too big for you!" Sue was sad, but then something unexpected happened. The coat started to talk! The coat said, "I am a magic coat. I can help you be strong!"
Sue was very happy. She asked the coat to make her strong. The coat did what she asked. Now, Sue was strong and not weak anymore. She thanked the coat and told her mom about the magic. Her mom was surprised but happy for Sue. They all had a fun day with the magic coat.
