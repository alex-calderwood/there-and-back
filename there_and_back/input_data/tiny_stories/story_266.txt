Once upon a time, there was a big rock. This rock was very old. It was so old that people called it "ancient". The rock sat in a park, and kids loved to play on it.
One day, a man came to the park. He looked at the ancient rock and said, "I will buy this rock. I will give a lot of money for it." The man told everyone that the rock had a big price. People were surprised. They did not know the rock was special.
But then, a little girl found a note under the rock. The note said, "This rock is not for sale. It is a gift for everyone to enjoy." The man was sad, but the people were happy. They knew the rock was special, but they wanted it to stay in the park for everyone to play on. The ancient rock stayed in the park, and the kids kept playing on it.
