One day, a boy named Tim and his mom went on a trip. They had to take the subway to get there. Tim was very excited. He had never been on a subway before.
As they got on the subway, it was very peaceful. Tim looked around and saw other people sitting and talking. He turned to his mom and asked, "Mom, why is the subway so peaceful?" His mom smiled and said, "Because everyone is happy and enjoying the ride."
Tim and his mom took the peaceful subway to the park. They played and had a lot of fun. At the end of the day, they took the subway back home. Tim was very happy about his first subway trip.
