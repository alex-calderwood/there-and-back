Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mimi. She had a pretty bracelet that she loved very much. One day, while playing in the park, she lost her bracelet. Mimi was very sad and knew she needed to find it.
Mimi asked her friend, Tom, "Have you seen my bracelet? I need it back." Tom was a naughty boy and said, "Yes, I took it. If you want it back, you must give me your candy." Mimi didn't want to give away her candy, but she needed her bracelet.
So, Mimi gave Tom her candy and waited for him to give her the bracelet. But Tom was very naughty and didn't give it back. He laughed and ran away with both the candy and the bracelet. Mimi cried and went home without her bracelet.
