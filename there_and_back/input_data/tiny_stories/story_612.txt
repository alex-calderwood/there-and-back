Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. She loved to take walks in the park with her mom. One day, they saw a beautiful pattern on the ground. It was made of pretty leaves and flowers.
Lily and her mom decided to make their own pattern with the leaves and flowers they found. They took turns picking up the leaves and placing them on the ground. Soon, they had a big, pretty pattern that looked like a big circle.
When they were done, Lily and her mom took a step back to look at their pattern. They were very happy with what they made. They held hands and walked back home, excited to tell their family about the fun they had making their pretty leaf and flower pattern.
