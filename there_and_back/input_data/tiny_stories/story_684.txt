Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a squirrel on a tree. The squirrel had a big nut in its mouth. Anna and Ben wanted the nut. They were envious of the squirrel.
"Let's scare the squirrel and take the nut!" Ben said. He picked up a stick and threw it at the squirrel. The stick missed the squirrel, but hit the tree. The squirrel was scared and dropped the nut. Anna and Ben ran to get the nut.
But they were not the only ones who wanted the nut. A big dog saw the nut too. The dog was hungry and fast. The dog ran to the nut and barked. Anna and Ben were scared of the dog. They stopped and turned back.
But it was too late. The dog was faster than them. The dog bit Anna's leg and made her cry. Ben tried to help Anna, but the dog bit his arm and made him cry too. The squirrel watched from the tree and laughed. The squirrel was happy and not envious anymore. The squirrel picked up the nut and ate it. The end.
