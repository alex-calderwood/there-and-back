Lily and Ben have a new puppy. His name is Spot. He is black and white and very cute. Lily and Ben love to play with Spot in the garden. They throw a ball and he runs after it. They give him hugs and kisses and he licks their faces.
One day, Lily and Ben want to go to the park with Spot. They ask their mom if they can take him. Mom says yes, but they have to behave. She says Spot has to wear a leash and listen to them. She says they have to be careful of cars and other dogs. She says they have to pick up his poop. Lily and Ben say they will do all that. They are very excited.
They put Spot's leash on and walk to the park. Spot is happy too. He wags his tail and sniffs everything. Lily and Ben see a big slide and a swing. They want to try them. They tie Spot's leash to a bench and tell him to stay. They say they will be back soon. They run to the slide and the swing.
Spot is lonely. He does not like to stay on the bench. He wants to play with Lily and Ben. He sees a squirrel and barks. He pulls on his leash and tries to chase it. He breaks his leash and runs after the squirrel. He does not see the cars and the other dogs. He does not hear Lily and Ben calling him.
Lily and Ben are worried. They see Spot running away. They leave the slide and the swing and run after him. They shout his name and tell him to come back. They are scared he will get hurt. They hope he will behave and stop.
Will Lily and Ben catch Spot? Will Spot be safe? Will Mom be angry? What do you think?
