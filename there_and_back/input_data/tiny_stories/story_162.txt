One day, a boy named Tim went to the park. It was hot outside, so he brought a sandwich to eat. He sat under a big tree to stay cool. Tim was happy because he made the sandwich all by himself. He felt proud to own his special sandwich.
Soon, a little girl named Sue came by. She saw Tim's sandwich and said, "Can I have some? I am hungry." Tim looked at his sandwich and then at Sue. He thought for a moment and said, "Yes, we can share it."
Tim and Sue sat under the big tree and ate the sandwich together. They laughed and talked as they enjoyed the yummy sandwich. After they finished, they played in the park until it was time to go home. Tim was glad he shared his sandwich and made a new friend.
