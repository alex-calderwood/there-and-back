One day, a great big motorcycle had to deliver a box. The box was very important. The motorcycle went fast on the road to take the box to the right place.
On the way, the motorcycle met a big dog. The dog wanted to play and barked at the motorcycle. The motorcycle was scared and did not know what to do. The dog kept barking and tried to take the box.
The motorcycle thought hard and had an idea. It went very fast and made a loud noise. The dog was scared and ran away. The motorcycle was happy and could deliver the box now. The box was safe and the motorcycle was proud.
