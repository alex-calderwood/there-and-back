Once upon a time, there was a silly little fox. He was always playing around and searching for adventures. One day, he saw a tall pine tree in the forest. He got very excited and decided to climb it. As he was halfway up, he accidentally destroyed one of the branches. He quickly got off the tree, feeling very embarrassed.
He quickly ran away, but the pine tree would not forget him. The next day, he came back to the tree, apologising and asking for forgiveness. Surprisingly, the tree said "yes"! It was so very happy that the fox had done the right thing and asked for forgiveness. 
From that day on, the fox and the pine tree became best friends. They would play together in the trees every day, until the sun went down.
