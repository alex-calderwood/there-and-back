Once upon a time, there was a messy little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play in the dirt all day. He would come home with mud on his hands, face, and clothes. His mom would always shake her head and say, "You are so messy, Tim!"
One week, Tim's best friend, Sam, went away on a trip with his family. Tim felt sad and missed Sam a lot. He didn't want to play in the dirt by himself. So, he stayed inside and looked out the window, hoping Sam would come back soon.
Tim's mom saw that he was sad and wanted to comfort him. She gave him a big hug and said, "Don't worry, Tim. Sam will be back soon, and you can play together again." Tim smiled and felt better. He knew his mom was right, and he couldn't wait for Sam to come back so they could be messy together again.
