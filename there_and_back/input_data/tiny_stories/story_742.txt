Once upon a time, there was a pale cat named Sam. Sam liked to nap all day under a big tree. One day, Sam heard a loud noise. It was a horn! Sam woke up from his nap and looked around.
Sam saw a big truck with a horn. The truck was stuck in the mud. The man in the truck was sad. He needed help to get out. Sam thought of a plan.
Sam ran to find his friend, the strong horse. The horse came and pulled the truck out of the mud with a rope. The man was happy and honked the horn again. Sam and the horse were heroes! They went back to the big tree, and Sam took another nap.
