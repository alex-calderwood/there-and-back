Once upon a time, there was a bald man named Dave. He had nothing to do and was very bored. He decided to go to the park and play. 
At the park, Dave saw a little boy playing by himself. He walked over and asked, "What are you playing?" 
The little boy said, "I'm playing with my toy ship." 
Dave smiled and asked, "Where are you sending your ship to?" 
The little boy said, "On an adventure!" 
Dave asked, "Would you like help sending your ship on an adventure?" 
The little boy beamed and said, "Yes please!" 
Dave said, "Hop aboard, let's go!" 
The little boy and Dave played together for the rest of the day by sending the little boy's toy ship on big adventures. They had so much fun!
