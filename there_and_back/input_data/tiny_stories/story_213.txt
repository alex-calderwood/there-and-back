Once upon a time, there was a little fish named Fin. Fin lived in the sea. He had many friends, but his best friend was a big, harmless whale named Willy. They liked to play together and swim in the deep blue sea. Fin knew he was safe with his friend Willy.
One day, while they were playing, a small boat came near them. A little girl named Lily was on the boat. She saw Fin and Willy and said, "Hello, fish! Hello, whale! I like the sea too!" Fin and Willy were happy to meet Lily and they played together all day. They splashed water and had lots of fun.
As the sun was setting, Lily said, "I have to go home now. I will come back to see you soon!" Fin and Willy said goodbye to their new friend. They knew they would see Lily again and have more fun days in the sea together.
