Once upon a time, a helpful cat named Kitty lived in a small house. One day, Kitty found a big bottle of ink. She thought, "I can use this ink to help my friends."
Kitty went to her friend, Dog, who had a dirty paw. She used the ink to make his paw clean again. Dog was very happy and said, "Thank you, Kitty! You are so helpful!" This made Kitty feel good.
The next day, Kitty saw her friend, Bird, who had a broken wing. Kitty used the ink to make Bird's wing all better. Bird was very happy and said, "Thank you, Kitty! You are so helpful!" Kitty felt even better.
But soon, Kitty ran out of ink. She was sad because she wanted to keep helping her friends. Her friends saw her sadness and said, "Kitty, you don't need ink to be helpful. You can care for us in many ways!" So, Kitty learned that she could help her friends by caring for them, even without ink.
The moral of the story is that you don't need special things to be helpful. All you need is to care for others.
