Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They make noises like vroom and beep when they drive them.
One day, they find an enormous car in the garage. It is red and shiny. It has four big wheels and a loud horn. They want to drive it, but they do not know how.
"Can we drive this car, Dad?" Tom asks.
"No, you can't, boys. This car is not a toy. It is a real car. You need to be big and learn many words to drive a real car," Dad says.
"But we know many words, Dad. We know red, blue, green, yellow, car, drive, horn, wheel, and more," Sam says.
"That's good, boys, but you need to know more words. You need to know words like brake, gas, steering, signal, license, and more. And you need to follow the rules of the road. Driving a real car is not a game. It is serious and dangerous," Dad says.
"OK, Dad. We understand. We will wait until we are big and know more words to drive a real car. Can we play with our toy cars in the driveway?" Tom asks.
"Sure, boys. You can play with your toy cars in the driveway. But be careful and stay away from the street. And have fun," Dad says.
Tom and Sam smile and run to the driveway. They drive their toy cars and make noises like vroom and beep. They pretend they are big and know many words. They have fun.
