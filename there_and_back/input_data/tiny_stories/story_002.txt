One day, a little bird named Tim wanted to go on an adventure. He was an intelligent bird who liked to learn new things. Tim thought, "I want to sail in the sky and see the world."
So, Tim started to spring up and down, flapping his wings. He jumped high and soon, he was sailing in the sky like a kite. He saw big trees, little houses, and many other birds.
As Tim sailed through the sky, he met a new friend named Sam. Sam was a big, strong bird who liked to play. They played games and had fun all day. Tim was happy he went on his adventure and made a new friend.
