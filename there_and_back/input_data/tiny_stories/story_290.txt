Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim found a card on the floor. It was a license. He did not know what it was for, but he thought it was special. He put it in his pocket and went to find his friends.
Tim showed the license to his friends. They all looked at it and started to laugh. They thought it was funny that Tim found something he did not know about. One friend, Sam, was rude and took the license from Tim. Tim was sad.
Tim's mom saw what happened and came to help. She told Sam that it was not nice to be rude and take things from others. Sam gave the license back to Tim and said sorry. Tim and his friends learned to be kind and not laugh at others. They played together and had a fun day.
