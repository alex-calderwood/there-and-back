Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy safe where he kept all his favorite things. One day, Tim felt uncomfortable because he could not find his safe. He looked everywhere but could not see it.
Tim went to his big sister, Jane, and said, "Jane, I can't find my safe. Can you help me?" Jane thought for a moment and said, "Did you look in your room?" Tim shook his head no. Jane said, "Let's go look in your room together."
They went to Tim's room and searched high and low. After a while, they found the safe under Tim's bed. Tim was so happy, he hugged Jane and said, "Thank you!" From that day on, Tim always remembered to check under his bed if he couldn't find his safe.
