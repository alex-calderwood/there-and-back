Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Lily. She loved to draw pictures with her crayons. One day, she drew a big, beautiful rainbow. Lily was so proud of her drawing that she wanted to hang it on the wall.
Lily asked her mom, "Can we hang my rainbow on the wall?" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, we can use some tape to hang it up." Lily was so happy. Her mom got the tape and they hung the rainbow on the wall together.
Later, Lily's friend, Tim, came to play. When he saw the rainbow on the wall, he said, "Wow, Lily! That is a beautiful rainbow!" Lily felt so proud and happy. From that day on, she was not shy about sharing her art with her friends.
