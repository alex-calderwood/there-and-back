Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to cook. She would stir her food in a big pot. One day, her mom said, "Sue, we will have a test. You will cook for our friends."
Sue was happy. She wanted to be successful. She went to the store with her mom. They bought food for the test. Sue thought, "I will stir the food very well. Then, it will taste good."
The day of the test came. Sue's friends came to her house. She stirred the food in the big pot. Everyone ate the food. They smiled and said, "Sue, you are successful! The food is very good!" Sue was happy that her stirring made the food taste good.
