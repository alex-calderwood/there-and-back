Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was a restless dog who loved to play outside. One day, Max went to the park with his best friend, a little girl named Lily.
At the park, Max and Lily saw a lot of traffic. There were many cars and people. Max wanted to play, but Lily said, "Wait, Max! We need to be careful because of the traffic." Max listened to Lily, and they waited for the traffic to slow down.
When the traffic was gone, Max found a bone. He wanted to bury it in the ground. Lily helped Max dig a hole, and they buried the bone together. But then, another dog came and tried to take Max's bone. Max and the other dog began to argue.
Lily said, "Stop fighting! We can all be friends and share the bone." Max and the other dog listened to Lily. They dug up the bone and played together. From that day on, Max learned to share and be kind to others. And they all lived happily ever after.
