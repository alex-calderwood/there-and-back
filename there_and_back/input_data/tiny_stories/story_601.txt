Once upon a time, in a little house, there lived a famous man. He loved to fix things. People came from far away to ask for his help.
One day, a girl came to the famous man with a prune. The prune was broken. She asked the famous man to fix it. The man tried his best, but he had never fixed a prune before.
He tried and tried, but he could not fix the prune. The girl cried and cried. The famous man felt bad. He could not make the girl happy. The broken prune stayed broken, and the girl went home sad.
