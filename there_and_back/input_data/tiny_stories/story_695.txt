One day, a little girl named Grace wanted to be successful. She asked her mom for help. Her mom said that practicing a sport would help her to be successful. So Grace decided to practice balancing.
She started to practice every day. She would stand on one foot and count to five. She would try to balance on her hands too. Whenever she fell, she would try again.
Grace practiced and practiced until she got very good at balancing. Some people even said she was a very successful balancer!
One day, Grace showed everyone how she could balance like a pro! Everyone was so impressed. They said, "You're so successful at balancing!" 
Grace was very proud of herself. Balancing was her new favorite sport, and she was really successful at it!
