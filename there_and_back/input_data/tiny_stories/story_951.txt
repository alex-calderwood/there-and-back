Once upon a time, there was an adventurous little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her garden all day. One sunny day, she found a big, funny-looking potato in the garden.
"Hello, Mr. Potato!" said Lily. "Do you want to play with me?" The potato didn't say anything, but Lily knew it wanted to play. So, they played hide and seek, and they played catch.
At the end of the day, Lily was tired. She looked at her new friend, the potato, and said, "I had so much fun today, Mr. Potato!" Then, she gave the potato a big kiss. "Goodbye, Mr. Potato," she said, and went inside her house to sleep.
