Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his toys and take walks in the forest. One day, while walking, he found a big skull. The skull was very old and had a spoiled smell. Tim was curious and wanted to take it home.
When Tim took the skull home, he showed it to his mom. She was not happy to see the spoiled skull. She told Tim to take it back to the forest. Tim was sad, but he knew his mom was right. He took the skull back to the forest and left it where he found it.
The next day, Tim went back to the forest to play. He saw a squirrel playing with the skull. The squirrel was having fun, and Tim was happy that the skull was not lonely anymore. He knew that he did the right thing by taking it back to the forest.
