One day, a little red bird met a blueberry. The blueberry said, "Hi, red bird! Do you want to follow me?" The red bird said, "Yes, I want to follow you, blueberry!"
They went on a long walk. They saw a big tree, a small dog, and a green frog. The red bird was very happy to follow the blueberry. But then, something unexpected happened. The blueberry fell into a hole!
The red bird was sad. He wanted to help the blueberry. So, he asked the green frog for help. The green frog said, "I can help you, red bird. But you need to be kind and help others too." The red bird agreed.
The green frog helped the blueberry out of the hole. The red bird was very happy. From that day on, the red bird and the blueberry were always kind and helped others. And they all lived happily ever after. The moral value of the story is to always be kind and help others.
