One day there was a little girl. She was three years old and her name was Ann. She was a very obedient little girl. 
Ann asked her mom if she could go play with her friend Tom. Mom said that she could go, but she had to be very obedient. 
So Ann went off to play with Tom. They ran around and jumped and had lots of fun. 
When it was time to go home, Ann's mom asked her if she had been obedient the whole time. Ann said she had, so Mom gave her a big hug and a song. 
The song was something special that only she and Ann shared. Ann sang it all the way home, being obedient the whole time. 
 
When she got home, Mom said, " Ann, you have been a very obedient girl. You can have a special treat for being so good." 
Ann was very happy and said, "Thank you Mommy. I love singing the special song you gave me." 
And that made Mommy very happy.
