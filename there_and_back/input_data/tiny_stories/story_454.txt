One day, a girl named Lily and her friend, Tom, went to an island. The island was small and had many trees. Lily and Tom liked to play on the island. They would run, jump, and laugh all day.
One day, while they were playing, they saw a big bird. The bird was jealous because Lily and Tom were having fun. The bird whispered to them, "I want to play too, but I don't know how." Lily and Tom were surprised. They didn't know birds could talk!
Lily smiled and said, "We can all play together!" So, the big bird, Lily, and Tom played on the island. They had more fun than ever before. The bird was not jealous anymore, and they all became best friends.
