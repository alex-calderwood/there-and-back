Lily and Ben are twins. They are three years old. They like to play with their toys and books. They also like to learn new words.
Today is a special day. It is their birthday. They are very happy. They have a cake with candles. They have balloons and hats. They have presents from their mom and dad and their friends.
Mom and dad help them blow the candles. They make a wish. They wish to learn more words. They cut the cake and share it with everyone. They say thank you for the presents. They open them and see what they are.
Lily gets a doll. She likes dolls. She hugs it and gives it a name. She calls it Anna. Ben gets a truck. He likes trucks. He pushes it and makes noises. He calls it Bob.
They also get a book. It is a big book. It is heavy. They need both hands to hold it. It is a book of spells. It has pictures and words. They are curious. They want to know what the spells do.
They ask mom and dad to read the book to them. Mom and dad smile. They say they will read it later. They say it is a special book. They say they need to be careful with the spells. They say some spells are good and some spells are bad.
Lily and Ben nod. They are good twins. They listen to mom and dad. They put the book on the shelf. They play with their doll and truck. They celebrate their birthday. They are very happy.
