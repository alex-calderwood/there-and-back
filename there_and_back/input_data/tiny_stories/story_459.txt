Once upon a time, there was a tidy room with a big computer. A little boy named Timmy loved to play on the computer. Every day, Timmy would load his favorite game and play for hours.
One day, Timmy's mom asked him to help clean the house. But Timmy did not want to clean. He wanted to play on the computer. So, he said no to his mom and went back to his room.
Timmy loaded the game and played all day. When it was time for bed, his mom was sad. The house was still messy, and Timmy did not help. Timmy felt bad for not helping his mom. From that day, he learned to help his mom before playing on the computer.
