Once upon a time, in a busy forest, there lived a little bird named Blue. Blue loved to fly and sing all day long. One day, while Blue was flying, he saw a big log on the ground.
Blue sighed and thought, "I wish I had a friend to play with." He flew down to the log and sat on it. As he sat, he heard a small sound coming from inside the log. Blue got excited and listened closely.
The next day, Blue went back to the log and heard the sound again. This time, it was louder. Blue knew that something was about to come out. He waited and waited. Finally, a little bug crawled out of the log. Blue was so happy to have a new friend to play with. They played together every day, and the busy forest was filled with their laughter.
