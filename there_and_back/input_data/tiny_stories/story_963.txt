Once upon a time, in a big forest, there was a small bunny. The bunny was very healthy. It loved to eat good things like carrots and lettuce. The bunny had many friends, like the bird and the squirrel. They played all day long.
One day, the bunny found a new thing. It did not know what it was. The thing was round and red. The bunny showed it to the bird and the squirrel. They did not know what it was either. They all thought about what to do with the thing.
Then, something unexpected happened. The thing started to roll away. The bunny, the bird, and the squirrel chased the thing. The thing rolled faster and faster. Suddenly, it stopped near a big tree. The tree opened its eyes and smiled. The tree said, "This is my red ball!" The tree thanked the bunny, the bird, and the squirrel for finding his lost ball. They all laughed and played with the ball together. From that day on, they had even more fun in the forest.
