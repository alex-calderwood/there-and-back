Once upon a time, in a green forest, there lived a little bird named Bobo. Bobo loved to fly and sing all day long. One day, while flying, he saw something shiny on the ground.
Bobo flew down and found a small bell. He picked it up and said, "I will ring this bell and make a new song." Bobo rang the bell, and it made a pretty sound. He was very happy and played with the bell all day.
One day, a big storm came to the forest. The wind blew hard, and the trees shook. Bobo was scared and did not know where to go. Then, he remembered his bell. Bobo rang the bell as loud as he could. The sound of the bell was so strong that it made the storm go away. The forest was safe and green again. All of Bobo's friends thanked him for saving the forest with his bell.
