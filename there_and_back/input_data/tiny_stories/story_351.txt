Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play in his backyard. One sunny day, he went outside to play with his red ball.
While playing, Tim saw a big, dizzy bug. The bug was spinning round and round. Tim laughed and clapped his hands. He wanted to help the dizzy bug stop spinning.
Tim picked up the dizzy bug and put it on a nice green leaf. Soon, the bug stopped spinning. It was happy to be still. Tim was happy too. He went back to play with his red ball in the backyard. They all had a fun day.
