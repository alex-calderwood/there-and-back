One day, a little bird sat on a tree. The tree was very big. The bird was very loud. "Why are you so loud, little bird?" asked the tree.
"I am loud because I am happy," said the bird. "I like to sing."
The tree liked to listen to the bird sing. But one day, the bird did not sing. The tree was sad. "Why do you not sing, little bird?" asked the tree.
"I will sing soon," said the bird. "But first, I must remain quiet."
The tree did not know why the bird had to remain quiet. But the tree waited. Then, one day, something unexpected happened. Many more loud birds came to the tree. The little bird had invited all its friends to sing together. The tree was very happy and enjoyed the loud, happy songs of all the birds.
