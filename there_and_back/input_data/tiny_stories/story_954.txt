One day, a graceful cat went to the grocery store. The cat wanted to buy some food to eat. It saw many yummy things like fish, milk, and cookies.
The cat saw a big, soft toy. It was a cute teddy bear. The cat wanted to play with the toy, so it gave it a big squeeze. The toy made a funny sound that made the cat happy.
The cat took the food and the toy to the nice store person. The store person put the food and toy in a bag. The cat took the bag and went back home. The cat was so happy to have new food and a new toy to play with.
