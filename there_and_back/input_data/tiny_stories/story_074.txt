One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the park with her mother. They saw a big tree and Lucy's mother said, "Let's sit under the tree and have a snack." Lucy was very happy and sat down with her mother.
As they were eating, a small bird came by. Lucy said, "Hello, bird! Do you want some of my snack?" The bird was impatient and quickly took a bite. Lucy and her mother laughed.
Suddenly, the bird started to grow bigger and bigger! Lucy and her mother were very surprised. The bird said, "Thank you for sharing your snack. I am a magic bird, and now I will give you one wish." Lucy and her mother looked at each other, smiled, and made their special wish together.
