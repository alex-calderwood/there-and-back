Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim liked to wear his favorite uniform. It was blue and very comfortable. He wore it all the time, even to bed.
One day, Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw a big tree with a long branch. Tim wanted to play with the branch. He reached up and tried to pull it down. "Snap!" The branch broke off the tree.
Tim's mom said, "Oh no, Tim! Be careful with the trees!" Tim felt sad but he knew his mom was right. He hugged his mom and they went home. Tim still loved his comfortable uniform and promised to be more careful next time.
