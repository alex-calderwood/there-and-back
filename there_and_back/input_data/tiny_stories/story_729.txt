Once upon a time, in a small farm, there lived a cow named Daisy. Daisy was an honest cow who always did her best to perform her tasks. Every day, she gave milk to the farmer.
One day, Daisy saw her friend, Billy the goat, not giving milk to the farmer. Daisy asked Billy, "Why are you not giving milk?" Billy said, "I want to keep it all for myself." Daisy felt sad for the farmer and told Billy, "We should be honest and do our job."
The next day, the farmer was very happy because Daisy gave him lots of milk. He gave her a big hug and extra food. Daisy felt good because she was honest and did her job well. Billy saw this and decided to be honest too. From that day on, Billy also gave milk to the farmer and they all lived happily on the farm.
The moral of the story is to always be honest and do your best to perform your tasks.
