Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a little bird named Billy. Billy loved to sing songs. He would sing loud songs all day long. All the animals in the forest liked to listen to Billy's songs.
One day, a small mouse named Molly came to Billy. She said, "Billy, can you help me? I lost my way home." Billy stopped singing his loud song and said, "Of course, Molly. I will help you find your home."
Billy and Molly went through the forest, looking for Molly's home. As they walked, Billy sang a soft song to help Molly feel better. Soon, they found Molly's home. Molly was very happy and thanked Billy for his help. From that day on, Billy and Molly became the best of friends.
