Once upon a time, there was a shy little girl named Susie. Every day, Susie would bravely manage to pick a lemon from the tree in her backyard. That lemon was her main source of food, and she enjoyed it very much.
One day, Susie courageously managed to pick two lemons from the tree. She was so excited, she couldn't help but share it with a friend!
So, she nervously managed to walk up to a boy she had seen in the park before. She shyly asked if he wanted to join her for lemonade.
The boy smiled, and said yes.
But, when Susie started to pick up the lemons, the boy quickly snatched them away. He laughed, and ran away.
Susie was so sad, and managed to cry all the way home. She had not managed to get her lemons back, and could not enjoy her delicious lemonade.
