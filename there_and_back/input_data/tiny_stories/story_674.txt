Once upon a time there was a mom and dad. They wanted to have friends visit, but the fireplace was messy. Dad was really mad and he was using lots of big words. Mom wanted to help, but dad was impatient.
The mom and dad started to fight. It was hot and loud. Mom was trying to clean the fireplace, but dad kept pushing her away.
Then the little boy came into the room. He was scared, but he saw that mom needed help. So he ran to the fireplace and started to help her clean it. 
The dad looked angry, but he stopped pushing mom. He thanked the little boy and gave him a big hug. 
The mom and dad worked together and soon enough the fireplace was clean again. They had a nice visit with their friends and the little boy was very proud that he had helped.
