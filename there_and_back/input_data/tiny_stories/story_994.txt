One night, Tommy was in his bedroom playing with the flashlight. He shone it around the room, watching the light display off the walls. Suddenly, it rolled off his bed and onto the floor. He bent down to pick it up, but it was too heavy.
"I'm too lazy," he said sadly.
Just then, his mom walked into the room and saw the flashlight on the floor.
"Don't worry, Tommy," she said softly. "I can help you with that."
She reached down and easily picked the flashlight up.
"See," she said with a smile, "you can do it, too!"
Tommy grinned and thanked his mom. Then, he went back to playing with the flashlight, watching the beams of light display around the room.
