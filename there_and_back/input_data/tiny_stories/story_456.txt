Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a boy named Tom. Tom was a fair boy with a big heart. One day, he found a stick. He thought it was a fun weapon to play with.
Tom went to his friend, Sue, and said, "Look at my new weapon! Let's play!" Sue was scared of the stick and didn't want to play. Tom swung the stick and accidentally hit Sue. Sue cried and ran away.
Tom felt very bad. He went to Sue's house and said, "I am sorry. Please forgive me." Sue looked at Tom and said, "I forgive you, but promise to be careful next time." They hugged and went to play together, leaving the stick behind.
