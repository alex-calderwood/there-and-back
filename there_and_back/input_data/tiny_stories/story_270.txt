Once upon a time there was a bunny who loved to skip. One day the bunny was happily skipping along when it noticed a buckle in the road. 
"What's this, I wonder?" the bunny thought.
The bunny bent down to take a closer look at the buckle, and all of a sudden there was a voice.
"That's my buckle!" the voice said.
The bunny looked up, and there was a big bear standing there. The bunny was scared, but the bear had a gentle look in its eyes.
"It's ok, I'm not going to hurt you," the bear said. "But I need my buckle back, please." 
The bunny thought for a moment, then decided to take a chance. The bunny picked up the buckle carefully and handed it to the bear.
"Thank you," the bear said. Then it turned around and skipped away, leaving the bunny alone and safe.
