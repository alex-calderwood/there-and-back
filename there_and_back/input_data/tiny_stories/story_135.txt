Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She liked to play outside in the sun. One day, she found a sharp rock under a big tree. The rock was dark and shiny. Amy thought it was pretty, so she picked it up and took it home.
At home, Amy showed the sharp rock to her mom. Her mom was scared and said, "Amy, this rock is too sharp. It can hurt you." Amy did not want to get hurt, so she put the rock down. But she still thought it was pretty and wanted to keep it.
That night, Amy had a dream. In the dream, the sharp rock turned into a kind fairy. The fairy said, "Thank you, Amy, for not throwing me away. I will give you a gift." When Amy woke up, she saw a pretty doll under her bed. She knew the fairy was real and felt happy.
Amy learned that sometimes things that look scary can be good. She also learned to listen to her mom and be careful with sharp things. And from that day on, Amy and the doll were the best of friends.
