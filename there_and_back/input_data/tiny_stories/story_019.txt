Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to draw and make prints with his hands. One day, Tim found a big unknown box in his room. He did not know what was inside the box. Tim was very excited.
Inside the box, Tim found lots of colors and paper. He wanted to make a big print with his hands. Tim put his hands in the colors and then put his hands on the paper. He made a big hand print. It was so much fun!
Tim decided to show his mom and dad his big hand print. They were very happy to see it. They wanted to celebrate Tim's big hand print. So, they had a little party with cake and balloons. Tim felt very special and loved his big hand print.
