Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play with his big, round basketball. One day, he found an ancient, old tree near his house. The tree was so big and tall.
Tim went to the tree with his basketball. He saw a little squirrel on a branch. The squirrel looked sad. Tim asked, "Why are you sad, little squirrel?" The squirrel said, "I lost my nut and I am very hungry."
Tim wanted to help the squirrel. He said, "I promise to find your nut." Tim looked around and saw the nut near the ancient tree. He used his basketball to roll the nut to the squirrel. The squirrel was very happy and said, "Thank you, Tim!"
From that day on, Tim and the squirrel became good friends. They played with the basketball under the ancient tree every day. And they always kept their promises to each other.
