Once there was a girl named Lily. She had a pet cat named Max. Max was different from other cats. He had a big, fluffy tail and loved to play with Lily's brush.
One day, Lily could not find Max. She looked in every room of her house. Lily was sad. She wanted to feed Max his favorite food, but he was not there.
Lily went outside and called, "Max, where are you?" Max jumped out from behind a big tree. He had the brush in his mouth. They both laughed and went inside the house.
Lily said, "Max, you are so funny!" She took the brush and fed Max his favorite food. They were very happy together. Lily and Max played with the brush all day long.
