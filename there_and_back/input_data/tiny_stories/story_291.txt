Once upon a time, there was a dry, sandy desert. In this desert, lived an ostrich.
The ostrich lived in a place where there was no food or water. It was thirsty, so it ran here and there, searching and searching.
One day, the ostrich felt so exhausted that it wanted to take a rest but there were no shady trees to hide it from the hot sun. So, the ostrich decided to sleep in the sand during the day.
As the ostrich slept a magical thing happened. A strange rain began to fall, filling the desert with water. When the ostrich awoke, it was able to drink and eat.
The moral of this story is that every difficult situation can have a happy ending if you are brave, determined and never give up.
