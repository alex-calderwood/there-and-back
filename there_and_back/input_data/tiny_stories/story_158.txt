Once upon a time, there was a rare frog named Lily. She lived in a small pond with her friends. Lily was a very nice frog and liked to bring things to her friends. One day, Lily found a big, pretty rock. She wanted to bring it to her friends, but it was too heavy.
Lily asked her friend, the fish, to help her. The fish tried to help, but the rock was too heavy for him too. Then, they asked their friend, the turtle, to help them. The turtle tried, but he could not move the rock either.
Lily was sad because she could not bring the rock to her friends. Then, a big bird came and saw them. The bird was very strong and picked up the rock with its beak. Lily, the fish, and the turtle were happy that the bird could help them. Together, they brought the rock to their friends. All the friends played with the rock and had a great day.
