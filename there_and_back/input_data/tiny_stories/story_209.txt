One day, a boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. They saw a big jet in the sky. Tim loved jets and he was very happy. The sun was hot and dry, but Tim didn't care.
"Mom, can I have a sour candy?" Tim asked. His mom said yes and gave him a sour candy. Tim loved sour candy. It made his face scrunch up, but he liked it.
As they watched the jet, something unexpected happened. The jet turned into a big, colorful bird! The bird flew down and said, "Hello, Tim! Do you want to fly with me?" Tim was so surprised, but he said yes. Tim and the big bird flew up into the sky, and they had a fun day together.
