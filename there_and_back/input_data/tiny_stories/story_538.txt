Jimmy was very excited. He was going on a yacht trip with his family. They were all very grateful to be able to go on such an adventure.
When they arrived, Jimmy saw a huge yacht. He shouted “Wow!” and jumped up and down.
The crew went to work to get the yacht ready for the journey. They made sure everything was improved so Jimmy and his family would have a safe and fun voyage.
Jimmy asked his mom, “Will we be able to see any dolphins on the trip?” His mom smiled and said, “Maybe you will.”
Jimmy couldn't wait for the voyage to begin. He was grateful for the opportunity to explore and have new adventures on the yacht.
