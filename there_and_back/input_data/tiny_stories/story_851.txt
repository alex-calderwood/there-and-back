Sam and Lily are friends. They like to play outside. Today, they see fog in the air. Fog is like a big cloud that is close to the ground. It makes everything look soft and gray.
"Wow, look at the fog!" Sam says. "It is so thick. I can't see the trees over there."
"Me neither," Lily says. "But it is not cold. It is mild. Mild means not too hot and not too cold. It is nice."
They decide to go for a walk in the fog. They hold hands so they don't get lost. They see some birds and some flowers. They hear some cars and some dogs. They smell some bread and some grass.
They have fun in the fog. They pretend they are explorers in a new land. They make up stories and names for everything they see. They laugh and sing.
After a while, the fog starts to go away. The sun comes out and makes everything bright and warm. They can see the trees and the houses again.
"Bye bye, fog," Sam says. "You were fun. But I like the sun too."
"Me too," Lily says. "The sun makes me happy. And so do you. You are my best friend."
They hug and smile. They go back to their homes. They are happy. They had a good day.
