Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a toy bear that she loved very much. The bear had a big red bow and a happy smile. Lily took her bear everywhere she went.
One gloomy day, Lily and her bear went to the park. There, she met a boy named Tim. Tim had a toy bear too, but his bear had a blue bow and a sad face. Tim saw Lily's bear and said, "That bear should belong to me! It has a better style."
Lily was sad and didn't want to give her bear away. She loved her bear and knew it belonged to her. So, she told Tim, "No, this bear is mine. Your bear is nice too. Let's be friends and play together with our bears."
Tim thought about it and agreed. They played together all day, and their bears became friends too. From that day on, Lily and Tim learned that it's more fun to share and be friends than to fight over toys.
