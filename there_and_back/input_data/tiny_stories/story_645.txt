Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her toys. One day, she went to the park to play with her ball. She was very happy.
At the park, Lily met a boy named Tom. Tom was deaf, but he liked to play too. They played with the ball together, laughing and having fun. They became good friends.
One day, Lily fell down and hurt her knee. She started to cry. Tom saw her crying and came to help her. He gave her a big hug, and Lily stopped crying. They went back to play together, and they were happy again.
