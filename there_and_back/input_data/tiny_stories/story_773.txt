One day, a big squash grew in the garden. It was very big and round. The squash was difficult to move because it was so big. Tim, a small boy, saw the squash and wanted to take it home.
Tim tried to cover the squash with his hands, but it was too big. He asked his friend, Sam, for help. Sam said, "This is a big squash! Let's take it home together."
Tim and Sam tried to carry the squash, but it was very difficult. They were tired and sad. They saw a big hill and knew they could not carry the squash up the hill. They tried to roll the squash up the hill, but it was too hard.
At the top of the hill, a big rock was in the way. Tim and Sam tried to move the rock, but it was too heavy. They could not move the rock or the squash. They were very sad and tired.
In the end, Tim and Sam left the squash in the garden. They went home without the big squash. They were very sad and tired, and they did not get to eat the big squash.
