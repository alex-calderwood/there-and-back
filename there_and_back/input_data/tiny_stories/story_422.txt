Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to race with his friends. They would race in the park, in the yard, and even in the house. Tim was very fast, and he always had fun.
One day, it was very cold outside. Tim put on his warm coat and went out to play. He saw a big car. This car was a luxury car. It was shiny and pretty. Tim wanted to race with the luxury car, but it was too big and too fast for him.
Tim's friends came over, and they all raced together. They raced in the cold, and they raced near the luxury car. They had so much fun, and Tim was happy. At the end of the day, they all went home to their warm houses, ready to race again another day.
