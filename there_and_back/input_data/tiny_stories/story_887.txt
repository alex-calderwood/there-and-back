Once upon a time there was a little girl named Sarah. She had a special box full of crayons. Every morning, Sarah would take her box to school with her.
One day, Sarah loaded the box up with her crayons and took them to school. But when she got there, she realized that not all of the crayons were there! She had forgotten to pack some of the regular crayons!
Sarah was very sad. She wanted to draw a picture for her class, but she didn't have enough crayons. Then she had an idea. She asked her teacher if anyone in the class had any regular crayons that she could borrow.
The teacher checked, and it turned out that one of Sarah's classmates had extra crayons. They shared the crayons so Sarah had enough to draw her picture.
When she was done, Sarah loaded the crayons back in the box and proudly took her picture to show her classmates. Everyone oohed and ahhed at her pretty picture, and Sarah had a great day!
