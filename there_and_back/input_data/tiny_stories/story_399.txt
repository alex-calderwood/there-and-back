One day, a young girl named Sue put on her favorite skirt. It was a pretty skirt with many colors. She wanted to go play outside with her friends. Sue saw her friends march like little ants in the park. She thought it was fun and wanted to join them.
Sue started to march with her friends. They all laughed and had fun. But then, something unexpected happened. A little dog came running towards them. The dog was small and cute. Sue and her friends stopped marching and looked at the dog.
The little dog ran to Sue and started to play with her skirt. It was not trying to be mean, but it was a big surprise. Sue laughed and her friends laughed too. They all played with the dog and had more fun than before. The little dog became their new friend, and they all marched together in the park.
