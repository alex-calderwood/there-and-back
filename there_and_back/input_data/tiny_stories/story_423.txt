One day, Jimmy was at the park playing with his friends when he found a pillow. It was a very soft and pretty pillow and he really wanted it for himself. Without anyone noticing, he quickly grabbed it and hid it in his bag. 
Jimmy took the pillow home and snuggled with it in his bed, feeling proud of his stolen pillow.
A few days later, Jimmy took the pillow back to the park. He was showing it off to his friends when a big and scary man pushed his way through the group.
"You stole my pillow!" declared the man angrily.
Jimmy was scared but he shook his head firmly and said, "No, it's mine!".
But the angry man was too strong for Jimmy. He grabbed the pillow and said, "It was mine, it had my name on it!". 
Jimmy felt sad and angry at the same time. He wanted to keep the pillow but it was too hard for him to fight. He had to give up the pillow and watch as the man walked away with it.
