Once upon a time, there was a big red engine. The engine was very serious about its job. It loved to go fast and help people.
One day, the engine saw a little girl gazing at it. She had big eyes and a big smile. The engine wanted to make her happy. So, it went very fast and made a loud "choo-choo" sound. The little girl clapped her hands and laughed.
The engine felt happy too. From that day on, the engine and the little girl became good friends. They would gaze at each other and play every day. And they lived happily ever after.
