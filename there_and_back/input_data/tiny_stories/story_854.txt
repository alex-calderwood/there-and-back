Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to sing. Everywhere she went, she sang loud and happy songs. She especially loved to sing right before bedtime.
One evening, her mom showed her a special page in a book. On the page, there were pictures of yummy cupcakes! The little girl liked the pictures so much that she sang a song about cupcakes.
The next day, she and her mom went to a yummy bakery and got some cupcakes from the baker. The little girl was so excited that she sang a song about cupcakes all the way home.
When they got home, the little girl ate the cupcakes with a big smile on her face. They were so yummy that she sang a happy song about cupcakes to everyone in the house. 
And that's how the little girl ended up singing about cupcakes every day!
