Once upon a time, there was a panda named Pandy. Pandy loved to nap all day. One day, Pandy was napping under a big tree. The sun was warm and the wind was soft. Pandy was very happy.
A little bird came and sat on the tree. The bird was very alert. The bird saw a big fruit on the tree. The bird said, "Pandy, look up! There is a big fruit. It will fall on you!" Pandy opened one eye and said, "I am napping. I do not want to move."
Suddenly, the big fruit fell from the tree. But instead of hitting Pandy, it rolled away. Pandy jumped up and saw the fruit rolling down a hill. Pandy was not sleepy anymore. He ran after the fruit and had so much fun playing with it. Pandy learned that sometimes it is good to be alert, just like the little bird.
