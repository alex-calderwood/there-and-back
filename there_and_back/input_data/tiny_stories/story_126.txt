Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She lived in a small house with her mom and dad. Lucy loved to watch the sunset every day. It was so pretty and made her feel happy.
One day, Lucy and her mom went to the store. They bought many things, like food and toys. Lucy saw a sour candy that she wanted to try. Her mom said yes, and they bought it too. Lucy was very excited to taste the sour candy.
When they got home, Lucy tried the sour candy. She made a funny face because it was so sour! But she liked it. After that, Lucy and her mom went outside to watch the sunset together. Lucy felt happy because she had a fun day with her mom.
