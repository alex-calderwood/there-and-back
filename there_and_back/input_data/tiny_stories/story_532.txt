Once upon a time, there was a brown bear named Bobby. Bobby loved to dance. Every day, he would dance in the woods. All his friends would come and watch him dance.
One day, Bobby found a shelf in the woods. It was a big, wooden shelf. He thought, "I can dance on this shelf, and all my friends can see me better." So, Bobby climbed up on the shelf and started to dance.
As he danced, a little bird flew by and said, "Hi, Bobby! I like your dancing." Bobby smiled and said, "Thank you, little bird. I like to dance on this shelf." But then, something unexpected happened. The shelf started to move! It was not a shelf at all, but a giant turtle! The turtle said, "I like your dancing too, Bobby. Let's dance together!" And so, Bobby, the turtle, and all their friends danced happily in the woods.
