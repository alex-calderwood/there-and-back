Once upon a time, there was a big race in a small town. All the animals wanted to win the race. The prize was a big, yummy cake.
In the race, there was a fast rabbit and an old turtle. The rabbit said, "I am so fast, I will win the race and eat the cake!" The old turtle said, "I may be slow, but I will try my best."
The race started, and the rabbit ran very fast. The old turtle walked slowly but did not stop. The rabbit saw the turtle far behind and thought, "I can rest and still win." So, the rabbit took a nap under a tree.
The old turtle kept walking and passed the sleeping rabbit. The animals cheered, "Go, turtle, go!" The rabbit woke up and saw the old turtle near the finish line. The rabbit raced to catch up, but it was too late. The old turtle won the race and got the cake.
The animals learned that it is important to always try your best and never give up, even when things seem hard.
