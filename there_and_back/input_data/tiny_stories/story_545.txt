Lily and Ben went to the park with their mom. They saw a big pond with many birds. Lily liked the ducks and Ben liked the swans. They had some bread to feed them.
"Look, mom, the swans are so pretty!" Ben said. He threw some bread to the swans. They came closer and ate the bread.
"Lily, do you want to feed the swans too?" mom asked.
"No, I don't like the swans. They are mean and scary. I only like the ducks. They are nice and cute." Lily said. She refused to feed the swans. She only fed the ducks.
One of the swans heard Lily and felt sad. He wanted to be friends with her. He swam to her and tried to take some bread from her hand. But Lily was afraid and screamed. She dropped the bread and ran away.
"Mom, the swan tried to bite me!" Lily cried.
"No, Lily, the swan did not try to bite you. He only wanted some bread and your friendship. He is a smart and gentle swan. He does not hurt anyone. You should not judge him by his looks. You should be kind and share with him." mom said.
Lily felt sorry for the swan. She realized she was wrong. She went back to the pond and gave some bread to the swan. The swan was happy and smiled at her. He gave her a feather as a gift. Lily and the swan became friends.
The moral of the story is: Don't judge a book by its cover. Be kind and share with others.
