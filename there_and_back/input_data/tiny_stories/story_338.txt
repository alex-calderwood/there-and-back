One day, Billy and his mom took a trip to the farm. When they got there, there were so many animals for them to see! Even from the bottom of the hill, Billy could see a huge horse standing in the field. 
"Wow, mom, what is that big animal?", asked Billy.
"That is a horse, sweetie," his mom replied. 
Billy and his mom ran up the hill for a closer look. It seemed like the horse was almost as big as the house! 
"Look, Billy, the horse has a friend!" said his mom. "That's a donkey! It's not as big as the horse, but it's still huge." 
Billy was so excited to be at the farm. He waved at the horse and the donkey, and they motioned back to him. 
"Let's go see what other animals we can find!" said Billy. He and his mom ran off to explore the rest of the farm.
