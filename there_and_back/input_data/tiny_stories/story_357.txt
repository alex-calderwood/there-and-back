Once upon a time, in a little town, there was a mighty elephant named Ella. Ella loved to eat peanuts all day long. One day, she saw a little boy named Timmy.
Timmy asked Ella, "Do you recommend any food for me to try?" Ella thought for a moment and said, "I love peanuts! You should try them too!"
So, Timmy and Ella went to the market to buy peanuts. They shared the peanuts and had a great time. They became best friends and played together every day. And from that day on, Timmy loved peanuts just as much as Ella did.
