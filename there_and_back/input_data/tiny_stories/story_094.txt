Once upon a time, there was a humble cat named Tom. Tom lived in a small house with his friend, Jane. One day, Jane had a gift for Tom. She put the gift on the table and said, "Tom, I have something for you."
Tom stared at the gift, excited to see what was inside. He opened the gift and found a new toy. Tom and Jane played with the toy all day. They were very happy.
But then, a big dog came into their house. The dog saw the toy and wanted it too. The dog took the toy away from Tom and Jane. They were very sad. The dog left with the toy, and Tom and Jane could not play with it anymore.
