Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play with their toys. But sometimes they did not want to share. One day, they both wanted to play with the same toy car. They pulled and pulled on the cord that made the car go. The cord snapped and the car stopped.
"Look what you did!" Lily cried. "You broke the car!"
"No, you did!" Ben shouted. "You pulled too hard!"
They were both very angry and sad. They did not talk to each other for a long time.
Mama saw them sitting on the floor with the broken car. She felt sorry for them. She came over and hugged them.
"I know you both love the car, but you have to share," she said. "Sharing is caring. Can you say sorry to each other and make up?"
Lily and Ben looked at each other. They felt sorry too. They nodded and said sorry. They hugged each other and Mama.
"Can we fix the car, Mama?" Lily asked.
"Maybe we can, but we need a new cord," Mama said. "Why don't you play with something else while I look for one?"
Lily and Ben agreed. They decided to play with their blocks. They built a big tower together. They had fun and laughed. They were not restless anymore. They learned to share.
