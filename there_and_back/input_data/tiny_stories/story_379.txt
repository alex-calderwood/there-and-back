Once upon a time, there was a busy little fish named Finn. Finn loved to swim all day with his friends in the sea. One day, Finn saw a tiny cell floating in the water. The cell was very small, but Finn could see it.
Finn swam up to the cell and said, "Hi, little cell! Why are you here in the sea?" The cell replied, "Hello, Finn! I am just floating around, looking for friends to play with."
Finn was happy to meet the cell and said, "You can be my friend, little cell! Let's swim together and have fun." So Finn and the cell swam and played all day in the sea. They had lots of fun and became the best of friends.
