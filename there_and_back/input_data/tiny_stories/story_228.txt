One day, a girl named Lucy went to the park with her mom. They saw a row of ducks by the pond. Lucy loved ducks and wanted to feed them. Her mom gave her some bread to share with the ducks.
As Lucy threw the bread, she felt her face get hot. She was embarrass because she tripped and fell. The ducks started to quack and laugh at her. Lucy's mom helped her up and made sure she was okay.
Then, something unexpected happened. A duck found a spicy pepper on the ground and ate it. The duck's face turned red and it jumped into the pond to cool off. All the other ducks stopped laughing and were surprised. Lucy smiled because now the ducks knew how it felt to be embarrass too.
