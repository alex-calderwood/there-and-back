One day, a little girl named Lily found a big piano in her house. She was very happy. She wanted to play the piano and make music. But she was scared. She did not know how to play the piano.
Lily's mom saw her and said, "Do not be scared, Lily. I will teach you how to play the piano." They started to play together. Lily was having fun. She was not scared anymore.
Then, something unexpected happened. A little mouse came out from under the piano. It pinched Lily's toe. Lily was scared again. But the mouse said, "I am sorry, Lily. I just wanted to play the piano too." Lily and the mouse became friends and played the piano together.
