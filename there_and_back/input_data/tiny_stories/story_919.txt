Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside. He would run, jump, and laugh. He was very healthy.
One day, while playing, Tim got his shirt very dirty. It had mud, grass, and juice on it. He went to his mom and said, "Mom, my shirt is dirty. Can you replace it with a clean one?"
His mom looked at his shirt and said, "Yes, Tim. Let's go inside and get a new shirt for you." They went inside the house, and Tim's mom helped him pick a new shirt. It was red and had a big smiley face on it. Tim was happy to wear his new shirt.
Now that Tim had a clean shirt, he went back outside to play. He was careful not to get his new shirt dirty. Tim played with his friends, and they all had a fun and healthy day.
