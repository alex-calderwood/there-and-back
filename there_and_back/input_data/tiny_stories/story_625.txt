Once upon a time, there was a mean old lady who insisted that she should have the brightest star in the sky. She lived in a little cottage alone and had nothing else. 
She was so insistent that the people in the village had no choice but to take her outside one night to get the star she wanted. However, the star was very high up in the sky and so far away that it seemed impossible to get it for her. 
The mean old lady then became very angry and bitter. She screamed and shouted at them until finally she insisted that they get a ladder and take the star for her. The people were afraid, but they had no choice in the end. 
So, eventually one brave person got a ladder and slowly climbed up to get the star. But when he tried to take it, it suddenly glowed very brightly and shone so brightly that he had to jump back down. Sadly, in his haste he dropped the star, which broke into millions of pieces and scattered all over the sky. 
The mean old lady's dream of having the brightest star was destroyed and she was left with nothing. From that day onwards, the sky would always look a little bit darker, and the mean old lady had only her own bitterness to blame.
