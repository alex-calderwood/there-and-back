One day, Tim and Sue went to the beach. They wanted to play and have fun. Tim was competitive. He said, "Let's see who can lift the most sand."
Sue said, "Okay, let's do it!" They started to lift sand with their hands. They made big piles of sand. Tim and Sue wanted to win.
Then, something unexpected happened. A big wave came and washed away their sand piles. Tim and Sue looked at each other and laughed. They learned that playing together was more fun than trying to win.
