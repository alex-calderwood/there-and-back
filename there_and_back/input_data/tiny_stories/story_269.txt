Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They liked to gather leaves and flowers and make pictures with them. One day, they found a big note on a bench. It had many colors and shapes on it. They thought it was a treasure map.
"Look, Ben, this is a map to find something fun!" Anna said, cheerful.
"Let's follow it, Anna, maybe we can find toys or candy!" Ben said, excited.
They took the note and ran to the first shape on it. It was a circle. They looked around and saw a fountain. They ran to the fountain and looked for the next shape. It was a triangle. They looked around and saw a slide. They ran to the slide and looked for the next shape. It was a star. They looked around and saw a big tree. They ran to the tree and looked for the last shape. It was a heart. They looked around and saw a basket. They ran to the basket and opened it.
But inside the basket, there was no toy or candy. There was a big snake. The snake hissed and jumped out of the basket. It bit Anna and Ben on their arms. They screamed and cried. They dropped the note and ran away. The snake slithered back into the basket and waited for the next children to come. The note was not a treasure map. It was a trap.
