Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a toy named Mr. Cord. Mr. Cord was a long, soft cord that Tim liked to play with. They played together every day. 
One day, Tim and Mr. Cord went to the park. It was a hot day, and they played under a big tree. Tim liked to swing Mr. Cord around and watch him fly. But then, Mr. Cord got stuck in the tree. Tim was sad and scared. 
Tim tried to get Mr. Cord down, but he was too short. He started to scream, "Help, help! Mr. Cord is stuck!" A tall man heard Tim's screams and came to help. The man reached up and got Mr. Cord down from the tree. Tim was so happy, he hugged Mr. Cord and said, "Thank you!" to the man. Tim and Mr. Cord went back home and played together all day.
