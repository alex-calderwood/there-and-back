Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a big red hotel. Many people came to stay in the hotel. The hotel was very pretty and everyone loved it.
One day, a strong wind came and broke a window in the hotel. The people in the hotel were sad. They needed to repair the window so the wind would not come inside.
A kind man came to the hotel with his tools. He worked hard to repair the broken window. Soon, the window was fixed! The people in the hotel were happy again. They thanked the kind man for his help. The big red hotel was beautiful and safe once more.
