Once upon a time, there was a soft fish who lived in a reef. The fish loved to play all day long. One day, the fish saw a big boat near the reef.
The fish swam up to the boat to take a look. There, it saw a man fold a big paper. The fish wanted to learn how to fold too. The man saw the fish and smiled. He took the fish out of the water to teach it how to fold.
The fish was happy to learn, but soon it started to feel bad. The fish needed water to breathe. The man didn't know that the fish was feeling bad. In the end, the fish couldn't breathe and it was too late. The man was sad and put the fish back in the water, but the fish didn't swim anymore.
