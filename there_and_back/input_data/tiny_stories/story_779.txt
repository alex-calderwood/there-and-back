Once upon a time, there was a warm sunny day. A girl named Lily went outside to play. She liked to skip and jump in the park. Lily saw her friend, Tom, who had a big bottle of ink.
Tom wanted to play with the ink. He opened the bottle and dipped his fingers in it. Then, he started to draw on the ground. Lily wanted to help, so she took some ink too. They drew a big sun and a pretty flower.
Suddenly, the sun and the flower came to life! The sun started to dance and the flower started to sing. Lily and Tom were so surprised. They laughed and played with their new friends. They skipped around the park, happy that their drawings came to life.
