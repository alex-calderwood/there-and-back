One day, a big oak tree was in the forest. It was very tall and strong. A little bird came and sat on a branch. The bird was sad and said, "I am so bitter because I can't find my friend."
A squirrel heard the bird and said, "I will help you find your friend. Let's go!" The bird and the squirrel looked everywhere for the friend. They looked up and down, left and right, but they could not find the friend.
Then, they saw something unexpected. The friend was hiding behind the big oak tree! The friend said, "Surprise! I wanted to play hide and seek with you." The bird was so happy and not bitter anymore. They all played together and had fun by the big oak tree.
