There was once a young girl named Amanda. She was very wealthy and had many toys. One of Amanda's favorite things to do was clap and dance.
One day, Amanda found an eraser and was very excited. She picked it up, ran around the room and clapped in joy.
Then, Amanda saw her mother in the door way.
Amanda said, "Mommy look what I found!"
Her mom said, "That's nice, dear. What are you going to do with it?"
Amanda smiled and said, "I'm going to clap with it."
And so Amanda's mom gave her some space and watched as her daughter clapped and danced around the room with her new eraser.
Both of them laughed and cheered as Amanda clapped with her new eraser, living the life of luxury that wealthy children can have.
