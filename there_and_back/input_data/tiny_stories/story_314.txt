One day, a cat with soft fur went for a walk. The cat was very calm and liked to make new friends. While walking, the cat saw a big box. The cat was curious and went to look at the box.
Inside the box, the cat found a hat. The hat was very big and funny. The cat thought it would be fun to wear the hat. The cat put the hat on its head and walked around. The cat felt happy with the hat.
Then, something unexpected happened. A bird saw the cat with the hat and thought the cat was a new friend. The bird flew down and started to talk to the cat. The cat was surprised but decided to accept the bird as a new friend. The cat and the bird played together and became best friends.
