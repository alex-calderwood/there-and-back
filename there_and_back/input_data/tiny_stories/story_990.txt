Once upon a time, there was a wise old dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with blocks. He would stack them up high and watch them fall down. One day, Spot saw a little girl named Sue. Sue was sad because she could not play with her blocks.
Spot went over to Sue and said, "I see you are sad. Let me help you play with your blocks." Sue looked at Spot and smiled. They played together and had lots of fun. They built a big tower with the blocks, and Spot showed Sue how to make it strong.
As they played, Sue learned from the wise Spot that sharing and helping others can make you happy. Sue and Spot became good friends and played with the blocks every day. They always had fun and were never sad again. And that's how Sue learned the moral value of sharing and helping others.
