Once there was a little squirrel named Sam. Sam liked to play pretend. He would pretend to be a slow turtle or a fast bunny. One day, Sam saw a big tree with lots of nuts. He thought, "I will pretend to be a slow turtle to get the nuts."
Sam started to walk very slow like a turtle. He got closer and closer to the tree. Other animals saw Sam and thought he was a real turtle. They did not take the nuts because they did not want to be mean to a slow turtle.
Finally, Sam got to the tree. He was so happy that his pretend game worked. He ate all the nuts and shared them with his friends. They all laughed and played pretend together.
