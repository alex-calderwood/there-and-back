Once upon a time, there was a sleepy cat named Tim. Tim liked to relax under the big tree in the warm sun. Every day, Tim would lay down and close his eyes to rest.
One day, Tim's friend, a funny dog named Sam, came to visit. Sam wanted to play, but Tim was too sleepy. Sam thought of a joke to make Tim laugh and wake up. "Why did the cat sit on the computer?" Sam asked. Tim opened his eyes and said, "I don't know." Sam laughed and said, "Because he wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!"
Tim laughed at the joke and felt less sleepy. He got up and played with Sam. They had lots of fun together. After playing, they both went back to the big tree and relaxed in the warm sun.
