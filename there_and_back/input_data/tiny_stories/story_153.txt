One day, a big purple cat went to an office. The cat wanted to stir a big pot of soup. The cat saw a man in the office. The man was sad. The cat asked, "Why are you sad?" The man said, "I am hungry."
The cat wanted to help the man. The cat started to stir the soup with a big spoon. The man watched the cat stir the soup. The man smiled. He was not sad anymore.
But then, something happened. The soup started to bubble and change color. The man and the cat were surprised. The soup turned into a big cake! The man and the cat laughed and ate the cake together. They were happy and full.
