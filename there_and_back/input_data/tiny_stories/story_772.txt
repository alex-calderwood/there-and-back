Once there was a pretty farmer. She lived on a big farm with lots of animals and plants. She wanted to take care of the animals and keep them safe.
One day, the farmer was walking around her farm. Suddenly, she heard a strange noise coming from the field. She went over to look and saw a fox!
The farmer shouted at the fox, "Go away! You can't stay here!" But the fox wouldn't leave. Then the farmer had an idea. She ran back to her house and grabbed her big bucket full of food. She put some of the food in the field and moved away.
The fox saw the food and ran after it. The farmer used the food to prevent the fox from coming back. She was so happy that she did it! She rescued the animals and made sure they were safe.
The farmer smiled and said, "That was pretty clever!"
