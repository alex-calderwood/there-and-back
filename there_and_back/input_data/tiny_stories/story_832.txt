Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She wanted to play on the swing in the park. She ran towards the swing and sat down. As she tried to keep her balance, she let out a laugh.
Suddenly, she heard a voice: "Do you need help, little one?" It was the nice old man from the bench. She was excited to meet him, so she quickly jumped out of the swing and said, "Yes, please!"
The old man smiled and said, "Let me fill the swing with air for you." He grabbed onto the heavy rope and began to push. As the swing filled with air, the little girl smiled.
The man said, "Now I'll hold the rope as you get on." He wrapped the rope around his arm and the little girl climbed onto the swing. She was so happy she shouted with joy.
The old man said, "Be careful and have fun, little one!" Then he walked away. 
The little girl was so excited to be swinging. But the higher she swung, the more frustrated she got. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't jump off the swing. She was stuck!
Suddenly, the old man came back. "Do you need help, little one?" he asked. She smiled and said, "Yes, please!" 
He grabbed the rope and helped her off the swing.
