Once upon a time, in a big farm, there was an unusual cow named Lulu. Lulu was not like the other cows. She had a big spot on her back that looked like a star. All the other cows liked Lulu, but sometimes they would miss her when she went to play alone.
One day, Lulu went far away to play by herself. She missed her friends, but she wanted to find new things. As she walked, she saw a big hole in the ground. Lulu was curious and looked inside.
In the hole, Lulu found a lost baby bird. The baby bird missed its mom and was very sad. Lulu knew she had to help the baby bird find its mom. So, Lulu and the baby bird went on a long walk. They asked other animals if they knew where the baby bird's mom was. Finally, they found the baby bird's mom, and they were very happy.
Lulu went back to the farm with her friends. She learned that it is good to help others when they are sad or lost. Lulu also learned that even if you are unusual, you can still do great things. From that day on, Lulu and her friends played together and helped each other all the time.
