One day, a little girl named Mia wanted to bake with clay. She found some smooth clay in her yard. Mia was very happy. She thought she could make a nice clay cake for her friends. She took the clay inside her house and began to work.
Mia made a big round cake with the smooth clay. She put it in the oven to bake. She could not wait to show her friends. She thought they would be very happy too. But Mia did not know that clay can turn very hard when it bakes.
When the clay cake was done, Mia took it out of the oven. It was not soft and nice like she thought. It was hard and not good to eat. Mia was sad. She tried to cut the cake, but it broke into pieces. Her friends came to see the cake, but they were sad too. The clay cake was not good for a party.
