Once upon a time, there was a healthy cat named Tim. Tim loved to play with his marble. Every day, he would roll the marble with his paw and chase it around the house.
One day, Tim saw the marble roll under a big chair. He leaned on the chair to reach for the marble. But the chair was heavy, so Tim had to lean harder.
Finally, Tim got the marble out from under the chair. He was so happy! He played with the marble all day long. And every time he leaned to get it, he got stronger and healthier.
