One day, Tom and Sue were playing in their room. They saw a long cupboard in the corner. Tom said, "Let's imagine that the cupboard is a secret door to a fun world!"
They opened the cupboard and walked in. Inside, they found many toys and games. They played for a long time. Then, they heard a voice say, "Hello, I am Mr. Cat. Would you like to play with me?"
Tom and Sue were surprised to see a talking cat. They played with Mr. Cat and had a lot of fun. But soon, it was time to go home. They said bye to Mr. Cat and walked out of the cupboard.
When they looked back, the cupboard was gone! They wondered if it was all a dream. But then, they saw a little toy cat on the floor. They knew that their adventure with Mr. Cat was real!
