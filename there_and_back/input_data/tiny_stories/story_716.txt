Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Bobby. Bobby loved to fly high in the sky. One day, while flying, Bobby saw a cheap, shiny toy on the ground. He wanted it so much!
Bobby asked his friend, Timmy the squirrel, "Can I have the shiny toy? It looks so fun!" Timmy replied, "You can have it if you win the race to the big tree!" Bobby wanted the toy, so he agreed to race Timmy.
They started the race, and Bobby flew as fast as he could. Timmy ran fast too, but Bobby was faster. Bobby reached the big tree first and felt so happy. It was a victory for him! Timmy gave Bobby the cheap, shiny toy, and they played together all day long.
