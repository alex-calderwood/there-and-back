One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a wide, white field with a big igloo in the middle. Tim walked to the igloo and went inside. It was very cold, but he liked it.
Inside the igloo, Tim met a small penguin. The penguin said, "Hi! I need help. Can you send a letter to my friend?" Tim said, "Yes, I can help you." The penguin gave Tim the letter and Tim went outside.
As Tim walked to send the letter, he saw a big, shiny box. He opened the box and found a warm hat and gloves. Tim put them on and felt warm. Then, he sent the letter to the penguin's friend. The penguin was very happy and said, "Thank you for helping me, Tim!" They became good friends and played together in the wide, white field.
