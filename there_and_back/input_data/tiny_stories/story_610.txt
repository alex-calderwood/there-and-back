Once upon a time, there was an old man named Tom. Tom lived in a small house. He had many friends in his town. One day, Tom got a package in the mail. It was a big, heavy package. Tom was very happy.
Tom went to his friend Sue's house. He said, "Look, Sue! I got a package!" Sue looked at the package and said, "Wow! That's a big package! What's inside?" Tom opened the package and found a pretty toy car. Tom and Sue played with the toy car all day.
Later, Tom found out he needed to pay for the package. He did not have enough money. He was sad. Sue said, "Don't worry, Tom. I will help you." Sue and Tom worked together. They did small jobs for their neighbors. Soon, they had enough money to pay for the package.
Tom and Sue learned that it is good to help each other. They were happy they could pay for the package together. The moral of the story is that friends help friends when they need it.
