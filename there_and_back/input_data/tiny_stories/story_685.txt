One day, a little girl named Lily went to the park with her mom. Lily loved to observe the birds, the trees, and the flowers. She saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. Lily's mom said, "Be careful, Lily."
As she was climbing, Lily fell and hurt her leg. It was a serious fall. Her mom quickly picked her up and took her home. Lily was sad and in pain.
At home, Lily's mom gave her some medicine to help her feel better. The medicine was sweet and made Lily smile. After a few days, Lily's leg was all better. She was happy and went back to the park to observe the birds, the trees, and the flowers again.
