One day, a little girl named Sue was playing near her house. She saw a stranger walking by. The stranger had a big bag. Sue was a stubborn girl and wanted to know what was in the bag. So, she followed the stranger.
The stranger stopped and opened the bag. He took out wood and started to make a fire. Sue was scared, but she wanted to talk to the stranger. She said, "Hi, I am Sue. Why are you making a fire?" The stranger smiled and said, "Hi Sue, I am making a fire to cook food. I am very hungry."
Sue watched the fire burn. She had an idea. She ran home and brought some food for the stranger. They both shared the food and became friends. Sue learned that sometimes strangers can be nice, and it is good to help others.
