Once upon a time there was a truck. He was carrying lots of boxes. He had to drive very far to deliver them.
But one day the truck got stuck in the mud. He was all alone and he started to get frustrated.
Right then an elephant saw him. He felt so sorry for the poor truck. He knew he had to help him.
So the elephant dug and he dug, until the truck could move again. Then he said, "there, all done! You can keep on driving now."
The truck thanked the elephant and decided to pay him back. So the truck gave the elephant a warm hug. The elephant felt very happy!
