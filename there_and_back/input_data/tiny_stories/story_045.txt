Once upon a time, there lived two best friends, Jack and Jill. They loved to share everything with each other.
One day, Jack found something very special at his grandma’s house. It was a big mirror. He thought, “I should share this with my friend, Jill.”
He quickly ran to show Jill the mirror. “Look what I found!” he said happily.
Jill did not seem so happy. “That’s mine!” she said. “My grandma gave it to me!”
Jack did not believe her. He said, “Let’s ask your grandma.”
So they went to ask her. “Yes,” said her grandma. “I gave the mirror to both of you. You can share it.”
Jack and Jill smiled. They hugged each other and said, “Let’s go get some delicious ice cream to celebrate!”
They decided to share the special mirror. From that day on, they shared everything with each other, just like they shared the mirror.
