Lily and Tom were friends who liked to travel. They had a big map on the wall with many colors and shapes. They wanted to see all the places on the map. One day, they had a big urge to go to the blue place with the waves. They asked their moms if they could go, but their moms said no. It was too far and too dangerous.
"But we really want to go!" Lily and Tom said. "We have a boat and a hat and a sandwich. We can do it!"
Their moms shook their heads and said they had to stay home. Lily and Tom were very sad and angry. They decided to sneak out and go to the blue place anyway. They took their boat and their hat and their sandwich and ran to the river. They put their boat in the water and started to paddle.
They were happy for a while, but soon they saw that the river was getting faster and wider. They heard a loud noise and saw a big wall of water coming towards them. They were scared and tried to turn back, but it was too late. The water pushed them and their boat over the edge and into the air.
They screamed and closed their eyes. They felt a splash and a bump. They opened their eyes and saw that they were in a big pool with many people. They looked around and saw that they were at the water park. They had traveled to the wrong blue place.
They saw their moms running towards them. They looked angry and worried. Lily and Tom felt sorry for what they had done. They got out of the pool and hugged their moms. They said they were sorry and that they would never do it again.
Their moms hugged them back and said they were glad they were safe. They said they would talk about it later and that they had to go home. Lily and Tom nodded and followed their moms. They looked at the map on the wall and decided that maybe they would travel to the green place with the trees next time. But only if their moms said yes.
