Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside in nature. One day, while playing, she saw a hurt bird. The bird looked sad and guilty.
Lily wanted to help the bird heal. She asked her mom, "Mom, can we help the bird feel better?" Her mom said, "Yes, let's give it some food and water."
They took care of the bird for many days. Soon, the bird felt better and could fly again. The bird was happy and not guilty anymore. Lily and her mom were happy too because they helped the bird heal.
