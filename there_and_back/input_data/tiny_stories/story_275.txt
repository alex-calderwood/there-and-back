Once upon a time, there was a dragon. The dragon was big and had a harsh voice. It lived in a cave near a small village.
One day, the dragon was very hungry. It went to the village to find some food. The dragon saw a woman cook. She was making a big pot of soup. The dragon wanted to eat the soup.
The woman saw the dragon and was scared. But the dragon said, "I am hungry. Can I eat some soup?" The woman said, "Yes, you can eat some soup, but you must be nice and not scare the village people." The dragon agreed and ate the soup. From that day on, the dragon was nice and became friends with the village people.
