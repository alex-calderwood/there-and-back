Once upon a time, in a large desert, there was a large cactus. The cactus had a friend, a small bird. The small bird lived on the cactus. The bird and the cactus liked to talk.
One day, the bird said, "Cactus, you are dirty. I will help you clean." The cactus said, "Thank you, bird. I like to be clean."
The small bird flew around the large cactus. It cleaned the cactus with its beak. The cactus was happy. The bird was happy too. They were good friends.
