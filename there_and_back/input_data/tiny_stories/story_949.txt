Sara and Ben are on a car trip with Mom and Dad. They look out the window and see many things. They see hills, trees, flowers, cows, and birds. They like the landscape. It is green and pretty.
"Look, Sara, a big lake!" Ben says. He points to the water. It is blue and shiny.
"Wow, it is so nice!" Sara says. She nods. She likes the lake too. She wants to swim in it.
"Maybe we can stop and play there later," Mom says. She smiles at them in the mirror.
"Really?" Ben asks. He is excited. He loves to play in the water.
"Really," Dad says. He nods too. He likes to see his kids happy.
"Yay!" Sara and Ben say. They clap their hands. They can't wait to get to the lake. They look at the landscape again. It is even more beautiful with the blue lake. They are happy.
