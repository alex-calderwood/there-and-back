Once upon a time, there was a famous cat. The cat was very good at dancing. Everyone loved to watch the cat dance. One day, the cat had a big show. Many people came to see the cat dance.
Before the show, the cat saw a big cake. The cat wanted to eat the cake. The cat put a finger in the cake and tasted it. It was so yummy! The cat ate more and more cake. But the cat knew it was not good to eat so much cake before the show.
The show started, and the cat began to dance. But the cat's belly was full of cake. The cat could not dance well. The people were not happy. They did not clap for the cat. The cat felt sad and had a big regret. The cat wished it did not eat so much cake.
From that day, the cat was not famous anymore. The cat learned a lesson. The cat knew it should not eat too much cake before a show. But it was too late. The cat lost all its friends, and no one wanted to watch the cat dance again.
