One day, a helpful boy named Tim went to the park. He brought his favorite toy, a big red bucket. Tim loved to play with his bucket in the sand. He would fill it up, turn it over, and make a tall sand castle.
While Tim was playing, a little girl named Sue came over. She was sad because she lost her toy shovel. Tim said, "Don't be sad. We can play together with my bucket!" Sue smiled and they both played in the sand, making big sand castles.
As they played, Tim found Sue's toy shovel buried in the sand. He gave it back to her and she was very happy. They learned that sharing and being helpful can make new friends and that it is good to be kind to others.
