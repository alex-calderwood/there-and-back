Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play outside with his kite. The kite was red and blue, and it could fly high in the sky. Tim wanted to make his kite fly even higher, so he waited for a day with lots of wind.
One day, the wind was very strong. Tim was excited and ran outside with his kite. He let the kite go up, up, up into the sky. It went so high that it almost touched the clouds. Tim was very happy to see his kite fly so high.
But then, something unexpected happened. The wind was too strong, and it pulled Tim up into the sky with his kite! Tim held on tight, but he was scared. He did not want to fly so high. Tim's mom and dad saw him and tried to help, but they could not reach him. Tim was stuck in the sky, and he could not come back down.
