Mary was playing happily in the garden when she discovered something strange. She saw a big, rough plank of wood laying on the ground. She touched it and it moved slightly. Mary was curious and eager to discover what was hidden under the wood. She used all her strength to move the heavy plank and was surprised to find a patient lying on the ground. The patient was patiently waiting for help. Mary ran to get help. 
Mary's mother soon arrived with a team of doctors. The doctors carefully checked the patient and treated him. The patient was weak but was recovering quickly. Everyone was relieved. 
But then something horrible happened. Suddenly the patient started shaking and had difficulty breathing. He was struggling to stay alive. The doctors worked all night, but their efforts were in vain. In the morning, the patient passed away, leaving everyone in shock.
Mary felt overwhelmingly sad. She had been the one to discover him, but in the end, she was not able to do anything to save him.
