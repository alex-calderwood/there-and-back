One day, a little boy named Tim went to school. In his class, there was a big blackboard. His teacher, Miss Lily, was a nice lady. She liked to help the kids learn new things. Today, they would study about animals.
Miss Lily drew a crazy-looking animal on the blackboard. It had a long neck, big spots, and four legs. "What is this animal?" she asked the class. Tim raised his hand and said, "It's a giraffe!" Miss Lily smiled and said, "Good job, Tim!"
The other kids clapped for Tim. They all wanted to learn more about animals too. They studied hard and had fun. At the end of the day, they all knew many animals. The kids learned that if they work together and study, they can learn new things. And that made them happy.
