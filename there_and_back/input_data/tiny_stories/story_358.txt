One day, a little girl named Lucy had a red shoe. She loved her red shoe very much. She wore it all the time. One day, she lost her red shoe. She was very sad.
Lucy asked her friend, Tom, "Did you see my red shoe?" Tom said, "No, I did not see it. But I will help you look for it." They looked and looked, but they could not find the red shoe.
Then, they saw a big bird. The bird had the red shoe in its beak! The bird flew down and gave Lucy her red shoe back. The bird said, "I took your shoe to provide a home for my babies, but now they have a better home." Lucy was happy to get her red shoe back, and she was glad that the bird found a better home for its babies.
