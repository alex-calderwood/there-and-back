Lila and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. They see a big ball in the sky. It is yellow and bright.
"What is that?" Lila asks.
"That is the sun," Tom says. "It gives us light and heat."
"Can we touch it?" Lila wonders.
"No, it is too far and too hot," Tom says. "But we can look at it with our eyes."
They look at the sun for a while. Then they see another ball in the sky. It is blue and green and white.
"What is that?" Tom asks.
"That is the earth," Lila says. "It is where we live. It has land and water and clouds."
"Can we go there?" Tom wonders.
"No, we are already there," Lila says. "But we can imagine it with our minds."
They close their eyes and imagine the earth. They see mountains and rivers and forests and animals.
"It is so beautiful," Tom says.
"Yes, it is," Lila agrees.
They open their eyes and smile at each other. They are happy to be on the earth.
They hear a voice calling them.
"Lila, Tom, it is time for a snack," the voice says.
They run to the voice. It is Lila's mom. She has a basket with apples and cookies.
"Please, can we have some?" Lila and Tom ask.
"Of course, you can," Lila's mom says. "You have been playing so well. Here, take an apple and a cookie. They are sweet and good for you."
They take an apple and a cookie and say thank you. They bite into them and enjoy the taste.
They look at the sun and the earth again. They are grateful for the gifts of nature and love. They hug each other and say:
"We are friends. We are happy."
