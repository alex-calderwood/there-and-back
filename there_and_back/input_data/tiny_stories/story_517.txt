Gina and her dad were out walking together. They approached a big field and saw a rare arrow lying in the grass. Gina’s dad said, “Gina, look! What a rare arrow! Let’s pick it up.”
Gina hesitated and said, “No, I don’t want to.” 
Her dad said, “Come on, Gina. We should accept it. It’s a special gift.” 
So Gina accepted the rare arrow and took it home. 
When they arrived home, Gina’s dad showed her how to draw an arrow on a piece of paper. He said, “Now, if you ever need an arrow you can draw one.” 
Gina smiled and said, “Thanks, dad. I accept the rare arrow and the lesson you gave me.” 
And so Gina kept the rare arrow, happy with her new possession.
