Once there was a bear who was very hungry. He searched around for something to eat, but he couldn't find anything. He needed help.
He walked up to a house and peered in through the window. Inside was a little girl who was fixing something with a hammer. The bear saw that the little girl was a repairperson and might be able to help him.
The bear knocked on the window and the little girl opened it. "Hello!" said the bear. "Can you fix me something to eat?"
The girl smiled. "Of course I can!" she said. She got some honey and some berries and mixed them together in a bowl. She handed it to the bear who gobbled it up.
"Thank you," said the bear. "You are the best repairperson ever!"
