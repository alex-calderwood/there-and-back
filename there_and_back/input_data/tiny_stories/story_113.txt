Once upon a time, there was a busy little squirrel named Sammy. Sammy loved to find peanuts and hide them in his home. One day, Sammy found a big peanut under a tree. He was very happy and wanted to take it home.
On his way home, Sammy saw a big bird. The big bird wanted the peanut too. Sammy did not want to give the bird his peanut. He paused and thought about what to do. He decided to run very fast with the peanut to his home.
Sammy ran and ran, and the big bird chased him. Sammy was scared, but he did not stop. He got to his home and put the peanut inside. The big bird could not get the peanut now. Sammy was safe, and he was very proud of himself.
