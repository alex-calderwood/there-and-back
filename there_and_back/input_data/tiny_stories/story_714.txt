Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big red ball that she loved very much. Every day, she would play with her ball in the park. The ball was amazing because it could bounce very high.
One day, Lily met a boy named Tom at the park. Tom did not understand how to play with a ball. He tried to kick it, but it did not go far. Lily showed Tom how to bounce the ball, and he learned to love it too.
They played together all day and became good friends. Lily and Tom now understood the love they had for their amazing red ball. They promised to always play together and share their love for the ball. And they lived happily ever after.
