Once upon a time, there was a big onion. The onion was very serious. It lived in a small garden with other onions. They all grew together, happy and strong.
One day, a little boy came to the garden. He saw the serious onion and thought it was funny. The boy wanted to eat the serious onion. So, he picked it up and took it home.
At home, the boy's mom cooked the serious onion. The little boy ate the onion and smiled. From that day on, the boy always remembered the serious onion he ate from the garden.
