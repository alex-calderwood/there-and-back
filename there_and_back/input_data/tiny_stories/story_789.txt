Once upon a time, there were two best friends - a dog called Lucky, and a girl called Jane. Every day the two of them would have lots of fun together.
One day, Jane and Lucky went to the park. When they got there, Jane said to Lucky, "Let's play a game - let's hide from each other!" Jane ran away and hid behind a tree, and Lucky ran and found a bush. 
When they were finished playing their game, they found a video camera on the ground. Jane said, "Let's separate the camera into two pieces and share it". So, Lucky and Jane separated the camera, each taking one piece.
Lucky and Jane ran back home, and were feeling very lucky to have found the camera. They were so excited to show their parents the video they were able to make with the camera. 
Their life was never the same afterwards, as they had so many fun memories they captured on video. Forever after, they would look back on the videos they had made and remember the times they spent together.
