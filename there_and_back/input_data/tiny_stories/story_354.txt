Once upon a time, in a big green forest, there lived an adorable bear named Benny. Benny had a lot of friends, like the birds, the squirrels, and the rabbits. They all loved to play together.
One day, Benny and his friends were playing near a big tree. Benny saw a long vine hanging from the tree. He wanted to swing on the vine like his friend, the monkey. But the vine was too high for him to reach. Benny asked his friend, the squirrel, "Can you help me cut the vine so I can swing too?"
The squirrel climbed the tree and cut the vine for Benny. Benny was so happy! He held onto the vine and swung back and forth, laughing and having fun. All his friends cheered and clapped for him.
After a while, Benny got tired and stopped swinging. He thanked the squirrel for helping him. All the animals continued to play together in the big green forest, having a great time. And they all agreed that Benny was the most adorable bear they had ever seen.
