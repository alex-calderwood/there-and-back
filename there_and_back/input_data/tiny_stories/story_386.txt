One day, a little girl named Daisy was walking in the forest. She was so excited to explore and discover new things. Suddenly, Daisy heard some voices and she was curious to find out what it was. She followed the sound, and after a few minutes, she arrived at a big lake.
"Wow!", exclaimed Daisy. She was so surprised to see the lake. Then, she heard a mysterious voice that said, "Look at me and learn what you should do". Daisy was startled, but she looked around and realized that the voice was coming from a duck in the lake.
The duck said, "You should never give up when it is hard. Hard work always pays off in the end!"
Daisy was a bit confused and asked, "What do you mean?"
The duck said, "It's simple. Whenever something is difficult, keep trying and never stop. Don't give up and you will be successful!"
Daisy was delighted by the duck's wise words. She thanked the duck and happily continued on her way with a valuable lesson in her heart.
