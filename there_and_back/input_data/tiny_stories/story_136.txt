One day Mommy had to deliver an important package. She asked her daughter to come along. It was a beautiful day, so they decided to take a walk. They soon came across a squirrel in their path. Mommy said to her daughter, “Let’s go around. We don’t want to startle the squirrel.” The daughter was dizzy with excitement.
The squirrel scurried away and the daughter chased it happily. Then, suddenly, the squirrel ran up a tree! The daughter gasped in excitement. She watched it climb up, up, up and disappear in the branches.
Mommy and the daughter continued their walk until they arrived at the house with the important package. She gave it to the woman who was standing in the doorway. The woman was so thankful and gave Mommy a big hug.
The daughter and Mommy were happy they had been able to deliver the package. As they walked away the daughter remembered the squirrel and the way it had made her feel so dizzy and excited.
