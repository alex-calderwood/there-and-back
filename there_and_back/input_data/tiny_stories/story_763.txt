Once upon a time, there was a helpful cow named Bessie. Bessie lived on a farm with her friends. She always tried to be very good and help her friends when they needed her.
One day, Bessie's friend, a little chick named Chirpy, lost her toy. Chirpy was very sad and asked Bessie for help. Bessie said, "Don't worry, Chirpy. I will help you find your toy." They looked all over the farm, but they could not find it. Bessie told Chirpy, "Let's remain calm and keep looking."
Finally, they found the toy near the big tree. Chirpy was so happy and said, "Thank you, Bessie! You are such a helpful friend!" Bessie was happy too because she could help her friend. They played together for the rest of the day.
From that day on, all the animals on the farm knew that Bessie was a very helpful friend. They also learned that when they needed help, it was important to remain calm and ask for help from their friends. And Bessie, the helpful cow, was always there to help them.
