One day, a little girl named Lily went to the market with her mom. She was very excited. At the market, they saw many things. They saw fruits, vegetables, and even a pepper. Lily's mom said, "Let's buy this pepper to put in our soup tonight!"
When they got home, Lily's mom started to make the soup. Lily wanted to help, so her mom let her put the pepper in the pot. They both smiled and laughed as they cooked together. Then, Lily's mom said, "Now, it's time for you to bathe before dinner."
While Lily was in the bath, she heard a noise. It was the pepper! The pepper jumped out of the pot and said, "Hello, Lily! I didn't want to be in the soup. Can I be your friend instead?" Lily was very surprised but happy. She said, "Yes, of course! Let's be friends!"
From that day on, Lily and the pepper were the best of friends. They played together, laughed together, and had lots of fun. And they never put the pepper in the soup again.
