Once upon a time, there was a smelly dog named Bob. Bob loved to play on the beach. He liked to jump and run in the sand. The beach was his favorite place to be.
One day, Bob saw some people on the water. They were standing on big boards. The people were riding the waves. This was called "surf". Bob wanted to try it too. He thought it would be fun.
Bob tried to surf on his own, but he was not very good. He asked a friend to help him. They practiced together. Bob started to improve. He became better at surfing. Bob was so happy. He loved to surf and play on the beach.
