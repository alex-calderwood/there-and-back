Once upon a time, there was a kind and compassionate cat named Kitty. Kitty lived in a small house with her best friend, a little girl named Lily. They loved to play together every day.
One sunny day, they found a big hole, or a pit, in their backyard. Kitty and Lily were curious about the pit, so they went closer to look. Kitty blinked her eyes and saw something shiny inside the pit. "What could it be?" thought Kitty.
Kitty and Lily decided to help each other to get the shiny thing out of the pit. They used a long stick to reach it. When they finally got it out, they found a beautiful, shiny stone. They were so happy to have found it together, and from that day on, they were even better friends.
