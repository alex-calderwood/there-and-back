Once upon a time, there was a big, high tree. In the tree, there was a small bird named Tim. Tim loved to sing and play with his friends. One day, Tim saw a yummy muffin on the ground. He wanted to share it with his friends.
Tim called his friends and said, "Look! I found a yummy muffin! Let's eat it together!" His friends were happy and excited. Tim led his friends to the muffin. They all took turns eating it.
After eating the muffin, they all played together. They had so much fun. The sun was shining, and they laughed and sang all day long. In the end, they all went back to the high tree and slept. They were all very happy.
