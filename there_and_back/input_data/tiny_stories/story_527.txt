One day, a little boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, were playing outside. They loved to play in the garage, where Tim's dad kept his big, fit car. The garage was full of fun things to play with, like balls and boxes.
Tim said to Spot, "Let's play hide and seek in the garage!" Spot wagged his tail, excited to play. Tim hid behind a big box and Spot ran around, trying to find him. Tim giggled as he watched Spot sniff and search.
As they played, Tim noticed a small, shiny key on the floor. He picked it up and wondered what it could open. Tim showed the key to Spot and said, "Look what I found! Let's see if it fits in the car!" Spot barked with excitement. Tim put the key in the car door and it fit perfectly! The car door opened, and Tim and Spot jumped in to play. They had the best day ever, and Tim knew he had found a special key to the garage.
