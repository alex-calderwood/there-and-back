One day, on a Wednesday, there was a big, ugly bug. The bug was sad because it was not pretty like the other bugs. It had a big nose and tiny wings. But the ugly bug wanted to be happy and have friends.
The ugly bug saw a pretty butterfly. The butterfly was very nice. The ugly bug asked, "Can I be your friend?" The butterfly said, "Yes, we can be friends!" The ugly bug was very happy.
The ugly bug and the pretty butterfly played together. They flew in the sky and played in the flowers. The ugly bug learned that it does not matter how you look. What matters is being kind and having a big heart. And the ugly bug was very happy to have a friend.
