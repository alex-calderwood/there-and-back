Once upon a time, there was a good boy named Tim. Tim had a big cardboard box. He loved his cardboard box very much. One day, Tim decided to polish his cardboard box to make it shiny and clean.
While Tim was polishing the cardboard box, he saw a little door on the side. He had never seen the door before. It was a surprise! Tim opened the door and looked inside. He saw a small, dark room. He was excited and scared at the same time.
Tim went inside the dark room. Then, something unexpected happened. The room started to glow! It was full of pretty colors. Tim was so happy to find this magic place. He played with the colors all day. In the end, Tim's cardboard box was not just any box, but a special, magical box.
