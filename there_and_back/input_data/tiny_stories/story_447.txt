Once upon a time, Sarah and her parents went on a picnic. Sarah was so excited! She was hopping up and down with glee. When they arrived, Sarah saw lots of lovely green grass where they could have their picnic.
Her dad set down the picnic basket and Sarah saw that it was overflowing with delicious food. She clapped her hands and her parents laughed. Her mom started to lay out the food on the grass. 
"Let's bow our heads for a moment and thank God for this food," said Sarah's dad. Together, Sarah and her parents bowed their heads in prayer. After that, it was time to eat. 
Sarah dug into the sandwiches and fruit, but they were quite messy. She had food all over her fingers and face. Everyone laughed at Sarah's messy picnic. As the sun began to set, it was time to go home but Sarah had lots of good memories of her messy picnic with her parents.
