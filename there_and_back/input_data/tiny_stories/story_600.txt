One day, a white cat was walking down the street. The cat saw a big truck coming. The truck had a driver inside. The driver was driving fast. The cat was scared.
The cat wanted to protect itself. It saw a tree and climbed up. The cat watched the truck go by. The driver did not see the cat in the tree. The cat was safe now.
After the truck was gone, the cat climbed down from the tree. It was happy that it could protect itself. The cat went home to tell its friends about the big truck and the driver. The cat was brave and smart.
