Once upon a time, in a big park, there was a row of colorful spin toys. Kids loved to play with them. One day, a little boy named Tim saw a new spin toy. It was cheap, but it was very pretty. Tim wanted to try it out.
Tim sat on the spin toy and started to spin around. He went round and round, faster and faster. He was so happy! Tim's mom watched him and smiled. She was glad that the cheap spin toy made her son so happy.
After a while, Tim stopped spinning. He was a little dizzy, but he had lots of fun. Tim thanked his mom for letting him play with the cheap spin toy in the row. They went home, and Tim told all his friends about the fun spin toy at the park.
