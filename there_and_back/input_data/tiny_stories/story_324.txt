Once upon a time there was a little girl. She wanted to try and chop down a tree with an axe. She was not very strong, so she went searching for a bigger and stronger axe. She eventually found an axe that was just the right size for her. 
The little girl held the axe in her hands and tried to swing it. At first it felt very strange, but then with a bit of practice she started to swing it with grace and ease. The axe fit nicely in her hands and she knew she could make it fit the tree. 
So, the little girl found a tree that she wanted to chop down. She took the axe and swung it gracefully. She hit the tree and chopped it down. The axe fit perfectly in her hands and the girl felt very proud. She had chopped down a big tree all on her own!
