One day there was a little girl called Daisy. Daisy loved to play games and loved to explore.
One day, Daisy decided she wanted to climb to the top of a tree. “I want to see what’s up there!” she said to her mom.
So her mom let her try. Daisy put on her pants and started to climb. She climbed higher and higher and got dizzy, but Daisy kept on going!
Then, finally, she made it to the top of the tree. Daisy yelled “I did it! I succeeded!” She was so proud of herself.
Daisy’s mom was proud too. She yelled up to Daisy, “Good job! I’m so proud of you!”
Daisy smiled and waved to her mom. She had succeeded and she was so happy!
