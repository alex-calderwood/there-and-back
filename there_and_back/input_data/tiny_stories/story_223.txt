Once upon a time there was a charming girl named Lily. She was three years old and loved to play with her friends. One day, Lily decided to do something special with her toys. She gathered all her toys together and decided to mix them up.
Lily held up a steel mixer and said, “This will make it extra special!” Her friends looked impressed and agreed to help her. Then they gathered all the toys and Lily began mixing them together.
When they finished, Lily and her friends stepped back and admired the beautiful, colourful mixing. They were so proud of what they had done that they decided to show it to their parents. The parents were amazed to see that their little girl had made something so beautiful and charming.
Lily smiled and said, “It’s been so much fun mixing with my friends.”
