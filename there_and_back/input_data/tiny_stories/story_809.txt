One day, a boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. They saw a big statue in the middle of the park. Tim asked his mom, "What does the statue do?" His mom said, "The statue does not do anything. It just stands there and looks nice."
Tim wanted to be like the statue, so he stood very still. A rich man walked by and saw Tim. The rich man thought Tim was funny. He gave Tim a big, shiny coin. Tim was very happy.
Tim showed the coin to his mom. She was proud of him. They went home and put the coin in Tim's piggy bank. Tim learned that sometimes, being still like a statue can be fun and make you feel rich.
