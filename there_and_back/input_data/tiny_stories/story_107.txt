One day, Tom and Lily went to the park with their mom. They saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They wanted to play on everything.
"Mom, can we go on the slide?" Tom asked.
"Yes, but be careful. It is very high," Mom said.
Tom and Lily climbed up the ladder and slid down the slide. They laughed and had fun.
Then they saw something strange. There was a giant in the park. He was very tall and had a long beard. He wore a hat, a coat, and boots. He looked crazy.
"Mom, who is that?" Lily asked.
"That is Mr. Brown. He is a friend of mine. He is not a giant, he is just very big. He likes to dress up and make people smile," Mom explained.
"Can we say hello to him?" Tom asked.
"Sure, but be polite. He is very nice," Mom said.
Mom, Tom, and Lily walked over to Mr. Brown. He smiled and waved at them.
"Hello, Mom. Hello, kids. Do you like my outfit?" Mr. Brown asked.
"Yes, it is very funny. You look like a giant," Tom said.
"Thank you. I like to pretend I am a giant. It makes me happy. Do you like to pretend too?" Mr. Brown asked.
"Yes, we do. We like to pretend we are animals, or pirates, or superheroes," Lily said.
"That is wonderful. Pretending is fun. It helps you use your imagination and be creative. Do you want to pretend with me?" Mr. Brown asked.
"Yes, please. What do you want to pretend?" Tom and Lily asked.
"How about we pretend we are in a fairy tale? I can be the giant, and you can be the heroes. Maybe you can save a princess, or find a treasure, or fight a dragon. What do you think?" Mr. Brown asked.
"That sounds awesome. Let's do it," Tom and Lily said.
They followed Mr. Brown to a big tree. He pretended it was his castle. He made funny noises and gestures. Tom and Lily pretended they had swords and shields. They had a lot of fun.
Mom watched them and smiled. She was glad they made a new friend. She thought Mr. Brown was not crazy, he was just playful. She liked that.
