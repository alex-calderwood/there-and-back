Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily. Lily liked to play with her toys. She had a toy box with a lot of fake toys. She had fake fruits and fake vegetables. She loved to play with them.
One day, Lily's mom said, "We are going on a trip. Let's pack our things." Lily wanted to bring her fake vegetables with her. So she put the fake vegetables in her little bag. She was very happy.
When they got to the park, Lily played with her fake vegetables. She pretended to cook and eat them. She shared her fake vegetables with her friends. They all had fun playing together. And they all lived happily ever after.
