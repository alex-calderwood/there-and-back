Once upon a time, in a big, green field, there was a charming little girl named Poppy. Poppy loved to play outside with her friends, the birds and the bugs. They would run and laugh all day long.
One day, Poppy saw a new friend. It was a little bird who could not fly. Poppy wanted to help the bird, so she made a sign. The sign said, "Help me fly." Poppy showed the sign to her other friends, and they all wanted to help too.
Together, Poppy and her friends made a plan. They found a big leaf and put the little bird on it. Then, they all pushed the leaf up into the air. The little bird was so happy! It flapped its wings and soon, it could fly. Poppy and her friends cheered and clapped. They had helped their new friend, and it was a very good day.
