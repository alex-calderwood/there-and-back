Once upon a time, there was a very organized line of ants. They were walking close together to find food. They saw a big bush with red berries on it. The ants were very happy because they loved red berries.
The ants worked together to pick the red berries from the bush. They carried the berries close to their home. The ants' home was a big hill with lots of little holes for them to live in. They put the red berries in the holes to save them for later.
The ants were very proud of their organized work. They knew that working together and staying close made them strong. Every day, they would go out and bring more food back to their home. And they all lived happily ever after.
