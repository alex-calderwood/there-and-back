Once upon a time, there was a sweet cat named Kitty. Kitty loved to play and have fun. One day, Kitty found a big box in the house. She was very curious about what was inside the box.
Kitty jumped into the box and found many colorful clothes. She thought, "Oh, I can dress up and look pretty!" So, Kitty started to dress up in the clothes. She put on a red hat, a blue shirt, and green pants. Then, she looked in the mirror and said, "Wow, I look so nice!"
Later that day, Kitty's friend, Doggy, came to visit. Doggy saw Kitty all dressed up and laughed. "Kitty, you look so funny!" Doggy said. Kitty smiled and said, "I know! I found these clothes in a box, and I wanted to look pretty." They both laughed and played together, and Kitty felt happy that she had found the box of clothes.
