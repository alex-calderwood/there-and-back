One day, a little boy named Tim was very excited. He wanted to have a tea party with his toys. Tim had a big toy bear, a small toy dog, and a pretty toy doll. They all sat on the floor in his room.
Tim decided to use a special mug for his tea party. His mom gave him the mug. It was blue with a picture of a happy sun on it. He liked the mug very much. He filled the mug with water and shared it with his toys.
The toy bear, toy dog, and toy doll all had a great time at the tea party. They drank from the special mug and laughed. Tim was happy to share his mug with his friends. They all played together until it was time for bed.
