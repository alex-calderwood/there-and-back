Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She loved to play with her toy dog, Spot. They would run and jump in the yard all day. One day, Sue found a big box. She thought it would be fun to mail Spot to her friend, Tim, who lived far away.
Sue put Spot in the box and went to the mail place. She gave the box to the mail man. The mail man said, "Okay, I will send this to Tim. But it will take a long time." Sue said bye to Spot and went home. She felt sad without her toy dog.
Days went by, and Sue missed Spot very much. Then, one day, Sue found a tasty treat under her bed. It was Spot's favorite. She felt very sad and cried. Sue never got to see Spot again because the mail man lost the box. Sue learned that it's not a good idea to mail your favorite toy away.
