One day, a big bear named Spot went for a walk in the woods. He saw many trees and flowers. He wanted to pick some flowers to take home. Spot found a pretty red flower and said, "This is the one I want to pick!"
Just then, a tiny mouse named Tim came out from behind a tree. Tim was mighty for his size and said, "Please don't pick that flower, it's my home!" Spot was surprised to hear the little mouse speak. He didn't want to take Tim's home away, so he decided to pick a different flower.
Spot and Tim walked together, looking for another flower. They found a beautiful blue flower that was not anyone's home. Spot picked the flower and they both went back to their homes. From that day on, Spot and Tim were the best of friends, and they had many fun adventures together.
