Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was in a class with his friends. They liked to play, laugh, and learn together. Their class was in a big room with many toys and books. They all had a lot of fun in the class.
One day, they heard a distant sound outside. It was a dog yelling. Tim and his friends went to the window to look. They saw a small dog yelling at a big cat. The cat was trying to take the dog's toy. Tim felt bad for the dog.
Tim said to his friends, "Let's help the dog!" They all went outside and walked to the dog and the cat. Tim yelled at the cat, "Stop! That is the dog's toy!" The cat looked at Tim and his friends, then walked away. The dog was happy and wagged its tail. Tim and his friends went back to the class, feeling good that they helped the dog.
