Sara and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to look for bugs and flowers. Sara saw a big beetle on a leaf. It was black and shiny.
"Look, Ben, a beetle!" Sara said. She wanted to touch it.
Ben came over and looked at the beetle. He was scared of bugs. He thought they might bite or sting.
"Don't touch it, Sara. It might hurt you," Ben said. He backed away.
Sara was not scared. She wanted to see the beetle up close. She reached out her hand slowly. The beetle did not move. Sara touched it gently. It was hard and smooth.
"It's not scary, Ben. It's just a beetle. It's hard, not soft. And it doesn't hurt me," Sara said. She smiled.
Ben was curious. He came closer and reached out his hand too. He touched the beetle. It was hard and smooth. He felt brave.
"You're right, Sara. It's not scary. It's just a beetle. It's hard, not soft. And it doesn't hurt me," Ben said. He smiled too.
Sara and Ben were happy. They had found a new friend. They named the beetle Bob. They played with Bob until it was time to go inside. They said goodbye to Bob and left him on the leaf. They hoped to see him again.
