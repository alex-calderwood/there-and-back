One day, a cheerful boy named Tim went outside to play. He saw that it was snowing. Big, white snow was everywhere. Tim was very happy because he loved snow.
Tim wanted to do something fun in the snow. He thought and thought. Then, he decided to make a snowman. He started to roll a big ball of snow for the snowman's body. He rolled a smaller ball for the head. Tim put the head on the body and gave the snowman a big smile.
Tim played in the snow all day. He was very cheerful and had lots of fun. When it was time to go inside, Tim waved goodbye to his snowman. He knew that he would have more fun in the snow tomorrow.
