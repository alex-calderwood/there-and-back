Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bowl on a bench. The bowl is ugly. It has cracks and stains and a bad smell.
"Look, Sara, an ugly bowl!" Ben says. He points to the bowl.
"Yuck, Ben, it is ugly!" Sara says. She makes a face. "Why is it here?"
"I don't know, Sara. Maybe someone left it. Do you want to touch it?" Ben asks.
"No, Ben, I don't want to touch it. It is dirty and icky. Let's skip away from it." Sara says.
"Okay, Sara, let's skip away. Skipping is fun!" Ben says.
They hold hands and skip away from the ugly bowl. They skip to the swings and the slide and the sandbox. They have fun and forget about the ugly bowl. They are happy.
