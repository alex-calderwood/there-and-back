One day, a little boy named Tim went to play in the yard. He saw an orange bird in a tree. The bird sang a happy song, and Tim felt happy too. He knew something fun would happen today.
Tim found a big rock in the yard. He dug a hole and found some black coal. He was very excited. He ran to show his mom the coal. His mom smiled and said, "Good job, Tim! Let's save this coal for later."
At night, Tim's mom made a fire with the coal. The fire was warm and bright. Tim and his family sat around the fire. They felt warm and happy. The orange bird flew by and sang its song again. Tim knew that finding the coal was the fun thing that would happen today.
