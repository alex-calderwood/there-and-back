Once upon a time, there was a famous cat. The cat had big eyes. One day, the cat went outside to play.
The cat saw a ball. The cat wanted to strike the ball. The cat said, "I will hit the ball with my paw!"
The cat hit the ball. The ball flew far away. The cat's friend, a dog, saw the ball. The dog said, "Wow, your eyes saw the ball so well!" The cat and the dog played together all day.
