Timmy hates medicine. It tastes bad and makes him feel sick. He does not want to take it, even when Mommy says it will help him get better. He hides under his bed when he sees the spoon.
"Timmy, where are you?" Mommy calls. "It's time for your medicine. Come out, please."
"No!" Timmy shouts. "I don't want it! Go away!"
Mommy sighs and looks under the bed. She sees Timmy's eyes in the dark. She tries to smile.
"Timmy, I know you don't like medicine, but you have to take it. It will make the germs go away and you will feel good again. Don't you want to play with your toys and your friends?"
Timmy shakes his head. He clutches his teddy bear. He does not want to leave his dark spot. He feels safe there.
"Please, Timmy, don't be scared. I'm here with you. I love you. The medicine won't hurt you. It will only help you. Trust me, okay?"
Mommy reaches out her hand. Timmy looks at her. He sees her kind face. He remembers how she hugs him and reads him stories. He loves her too. He feels a little bit brave.
"Okay, Mommy," he says. "I'll try it. But only a little bit."
Mommy nods and gives him a small spoonful of medicine. Timmy makes a face and swallows it. He thinks it is still bad, but not as bad as he thought. He feels proud of himself.
"Good boy, Timmy," Mommy says. "You did it. I'm so proud of you. How do you feel?"
Timmy thinks for a moment. He feels a little bit better. He feels a little bit happy.
"I feel okay, Mommy," he says. "Can I have a hug?"
Mommy smiles and hugs him. She kisses his forehead.
"Of course, Timmy. You can have a hug. You can have anything you want. You're my brave boy. I love you."
Timmy hugs her back. He loves her too. He does not hate medicine anymore. He hates germs. He hopes they will go away soon. He wants to play with his toys and his friends. He wants to have fun. He thinks maybe medicine will help him do that. He thinks maybe Mommy is right. He thinks maybe he will take it again tomorrow.
