One day, a family was talking about going on a vacation. They wanted to go to a place that was easy to get to. Mom and Dad mentioned the beach, and the kids got very excited.
On the way to the beach, they saw a big, scary dog. The dog was blocking the road, and they could not pass. They were scared and did not know what to do. The kids started to cry, and the vacation did not seem easy anymore.
But then, something unexpected happened. A nice cat came and chased the scary dog away. The family was so happy and thanked the cat. They continued on their way to the beach and had a great vacation. The cat made everything easy again.
