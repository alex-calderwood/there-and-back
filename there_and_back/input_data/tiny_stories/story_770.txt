Once upon a time, there was a big guard dog named Spot. Spot loved to weigh things with his paws. One day, he found a small rock and a big rock. He put one paw on each rock to see which one was heavier.
A foolish little bird named Tweetie saw Spot and asked, "What are you doing, Spot?" Spot replied, "I am weighing these rocks to see which one is heavier." Tweetie laughed and said, "You are a funny guard dog, Spot."
Spot and Tweetie became good friends. They played together and had lots of fun. Spot learned that it was okay to be a little foolish sometimes. And Tweetie learned that even big guard dogs can be kind and gentle.
