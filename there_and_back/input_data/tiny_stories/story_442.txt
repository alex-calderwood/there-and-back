Once upon a time, there was a little bug who loved to dance. The bug was very tidy and liked to clean its home. The bug lived under a big tree with its family.
One day, the bug wanted to have a dance party. It started to crawl to its friends' homes to invite them. The bug crawled to the ant's house, the bee's house, and the spider's house. All the bug's friends were happy to come to the dance party.
At the dance party, everyone danced and had fun. They danced under the big tree and laughed. The tidy bug made sure everything was clean and neat. After the dance, all the bugs crawled home, tired but happy from the fun they had.
