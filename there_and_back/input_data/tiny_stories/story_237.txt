Lily and Max were twins who liked to play with their toys. But sometimes they would quarrel over who got to play with what. One day, they found a shiny teaspoon in the kitchen. They both wanted to have it, because it looked like a powerful sword.
"It's mine!" Lily said, grabbing the teaspoon.
"No, it's mine!" Max said, pulling the teaspoon.
They started to tug and shout, making a lot of noise. Their mom heard them and came to see what was wrong.
"What are you two doing?" she asked, looking at the teaspoon. "This is not a toy, it's for stirring your soup. You could hurt yourselves or break it."
"But we want to play with it!" Lily and Max said together.
Mom shook her head. "You have plenty of toys in your room. Why don't you share them and play nicely? And if you want to pretend to be knights, you can use these." She gave them each a wooden spoon from the drawer. "These are safer and more fun than a teaspoon."
Lily and Max looked at the wooden spoons. They were bigger and had round handles. They smiled and thanked mom. They decided to stop quarreling and play together. They pretended to be powerful knights who went on adventures with their wooden spoons. They had a lot of fun and forgot about the teaspoon.
