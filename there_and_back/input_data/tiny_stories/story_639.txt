Once upon a time, in a big green park, there was a fat, happy dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his red ball. Every day, his friend Tom would come to the park and throw the ball for Spot to catch.
One sunny day, Tom and Spot were playing near a cross on the path. Tom threw the ball, and Spot ran as fast as he could to catch it. But this time, the ball went too far and landed in a tall tree.
Spot looked up at the ball, stuck in the tree. He was sad and didn't know how to get it back. Tom saw a long stick on the ground. He picked it up and used it to poke the ball out of the tree. The ball fell down, and Spot caught it in his mouth.
Spot was so happy to have his ball back. He wagged his tail and jumped around. Tom and Spot played with the ball for the rest of the day, having lots of fun in the big green park. And from that day on, they always played away from the tall trees.
