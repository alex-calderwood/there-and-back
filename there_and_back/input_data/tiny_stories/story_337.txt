Tom was a stubborn boy. He did not like to do what his mom and dad said. He wanted to do what he liked. One day, he saw a big cloud in the sky. It was white and fluffy and looked like a pillow. Tom wanted to jump on the cloud and play.
He ran to the hill and climbed up. He saw the cloud was close to the hill. He thought he could reach it if he jumped hard. He did not listen to his mom and dad who told him to come down. They said it was dangerous and he could fall. Tom did not care. He wanted to jump on the cloud.
He jumped as hard as he could. He stretched his arms and legs. He felt the wind in his face. He thought he was flying. But he was wrong. The cloud was not a pillow. It was not solid. It was air and water. Tom went through the cloud and did not stop. He fell down and down and down. He screamed and cried. He was scared and hurt. He saw the ground coming closer and closer. He wished he had listened to his mom and dad. But it was too late. He hit the ground and did not get up. He was gone. The cloud moved on and did not care.
