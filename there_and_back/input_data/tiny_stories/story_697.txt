Once upon a time there was a big boy who liked sports. He really liked to run and jump and play. He wanted to be successful. He practiced a lot and ran a lot and eventually he was quite good at it. He made a team of friends and they all practiced together. They even put on special clothes to play the sport. One day, after lots of practice, they had an important game. They all tried their best. They ran fast and jumped high and scored lots of goals. In the end they won and everyone was very happy. The big boy was successful! Everyone cheered and clapped and they all felt so proud. It was a very special moment and they all celebrated the success together.
