Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play with her ball. One day, she was playing in her house near the fireplace. She was very tired but she still wanted to play.
Lily decided to throw her ball up in the air. But something unexpected happened! The ball went into the fireplace! Lily was scared and didn't know what to do. She thought her ball was gone forever.
Then, a friendly cat came out of the fireplace with the ball in its mouth! The cat was not hurt and the ball was not burned. Lily was so happy and surprised. The cat became her best friend and they played together every day.
