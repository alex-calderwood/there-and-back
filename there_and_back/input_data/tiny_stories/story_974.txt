Once upon a time, there was a grumpy lion named Leo. He lived in the jungle with his friends. One day, Leo found a long spear. He wanted to test it.
Leo went to his friend, the elephant. He said, "Look, I found a spear. Let's test it together!" The elephant agreed, and they tried to use the spear to get fruit from a tree. The fruit fell, and they were happy.
Later, Leo met a monkey. The monkey was sad because he lost his toy. Leo said, "Don't worry, I will help you." He used the spear to find the toy. The monkey was happy, and they all played together. In the end, Leo was not grumpy anymore.
