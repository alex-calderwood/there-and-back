Lily was a shy girl who liked to play with her toy trains. She had many trains of different colors and sizes, and she liked to make them go on the track. She had a big track that went around her room, and a small track that she could carry in her bag.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and dad. She brought her small track and her favorite train, a red one with a shiny bell. She found a nice spot under a tree and set up her track. She made her train go around and around, and she smiled.
But then, she saw a big boy coming towards her. He had a mean look on his face and a big stick in his hand. He said, "Hey, what are you playing with? Give me that train!" He reached for Lily's train, but Lily was quick. She grabbed her train and put it in her bag. She zipped her bag and locked it with a small key. She said, "No, this is my train! Go away!"
The big boy was angry. He tried to pull Lily's bag, but Lily held on tight. He tried to break the lock, but it was too strong. He tried to hit Lily with his stick, but Lily dodged. She said, "Help, mom, dad!"
Lily's mom and dad heard her cry. They ran to her and saw the big boy. They said, "Stop that, you bully! Leave our daughter alone!" They scared the big boy away, and hugged Lily. They said, "Are you okay, sweetie? You were very brave."
Lily nodded. She opened her bag and took out her train. She said, "I'm okay, thank you. I love my train. It's my best friend." She smiled and hugged her train. She said, "And I love you, mom and dad." They smiled and hugged her back. They said, "We love you too, Lily. You're our best friend."
