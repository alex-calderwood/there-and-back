Once upon a time, there was a tall tree in a big forest. In the tree, there was a nest. A mother bird lived in the nest with her three baby birds. The baby birds were small and could not fly yet. The mother bird loved her babies very much.
One day, the mother bird went to find food for her babies. While she was gone, the baby birds saw a big, red ball on the ground. They wanted to play with the ball, but they could not fly down. The baby birds tried and tried, but they could not manage to get the ball.
Just then, the mother bird came back with food. She saw her babies trying to get the ball. The mother bird said, "Don't worry, my babies. I will help you get the ball." She flew down and pushed the ball up to the nest with her beak.
The baby birds were so happy! They played with the ball all day. The mother bird was happy too. She knew that one day, her babies would grow up and manage to fly on their own. But for now, she was there to help them.
