Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a red jacket that he loved very much. He wore it every day, even when it was hot outside.
One day, Tim went to the park with his mom. While he was playing, a big dog named Max came up to him. Max was a naughty dog, and he liked to tease Tim. Max grabbed the red jacket and ran away, laughing. Tim was very sad and cried.
Tim's mom saw what happened and got a big, delicious cookie from her bag. She showed it to Max, and he came running back. Max gave back the red jacket, and Tim's mom gave him the cookie. Tim was happy to have his jacket back, and Max learned not to tease his friends. They all played together and had a great day at the park.
