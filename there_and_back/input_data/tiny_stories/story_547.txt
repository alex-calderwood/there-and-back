One day, a pretty bird named Bella was flying in the sky. She had a message to give to her friend, Tim the turtle. Bella found Tim near the pond and said, "Hi Tim! I have a message for you from our friend, Max the monkey."
Tim was happy to hear the message. But as he listened, a big wind came and blew the message away! Tim and Bella were sad. They didn't know what to do.
Then, Bella had an idea. She said, "Let's go to Max and ask him to replace the message." They went to Max and told him what happened. Max laughed and said, "That's okay! The message was just a joke. I wanted to make you both laugh." They all laughed together and had a fun day playing by the pond.
