One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a big white hill. Tim wanted to play on the hill, so he asked his mom, "Can I play on the hill?"
His mom said, "Yes, I permit you to play on the hill, but be careful."
Tim was so happy! He ran up the white hill and started to play. He rolled down the hill, and he laughed and laughed.
Then, something unexpected happened. The white hill started to move! Tim was scared. But the hill was not a hill at all. It was a big, friendly dog!
The dog said, "Hello, Tim! I am a magic dog. Do you want to play with me?" Tim was not scared anymore. He played with the magic dog all day, and they became best friends.
