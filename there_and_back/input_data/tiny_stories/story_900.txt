Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily liked to wander in the woods. She loved to see the trees, flowers, and animals. One day, she saw a big tree with ash around it. The ash was from a fire that happened a long time ago. Lily was sad for the tree, but she saw that it was still strong and growing.
Lily had an idea. She wanted to help the tree feel better. She went to her mom and asked for some expensive seeds. Her mom gave her the seeds and told her to be careful. Lily took the seeds and went back to the big tree with ash around it.
Lily planted the expensive seeds near the tree. She watered them every day and watched them grow. Soon, there were beautiful flowers all around the tree. The tree looked happy, and Lily was happy too. The tree and the flowers became friends, and they all lived happily ever after.
