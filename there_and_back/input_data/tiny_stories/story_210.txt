One day, a queen lived in a big green castle. She was very nice and liked to meet new people. She wanted to introduce herself to everyone in her land.
One sunny day, the queen walked to the park. She saw a small girl playing with a ball. The queen said, "Hello, I am the queen. What is your name?" The girl looked at her and said, "I am Lily, and I am a princess." The queen was very surprised because she did not know there was another princess in her land.
The queen took Lily to the big green castle. They played together and had lots of fun. Then, the queen's helper came and said, "Your Majesty, Lily is just a girl from the village who likes to pretend she is a princess." The queen laughed and said, "That's okay. We can all be princesses today!" So, they all played together and had a great time.
