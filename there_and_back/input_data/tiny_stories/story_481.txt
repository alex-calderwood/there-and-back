One day, a huge comet came to the sky. It was very big and bright. It was so big that all the people in the town could see it. The comet was very happy to be in the sky. It wanted to make friends with the people in the town.
The comet saw a little girl named Lily. She was playing outside with her ball. The comet said, "Hello, Lily! I am a huge comet. Can we be friends?" Lily looked up at the sky and saw the comet. She was very happy to see it. She said, "Yes, let's be friends!"
Lily and the comet played together every day. They had lots of fun. One day, it was very cold outside. Lily wanted to help her new friend. She said, "I will wrap you in a warm blanket, so you don't get cold." The comet was very happy. It said, "Thank you, Lily! You are a very good friend."
Now, the comet was warm and happy in the sky. It stayed with Lily and the people in the town. They all loved the huge comet very much. And they lived happily ever after.
