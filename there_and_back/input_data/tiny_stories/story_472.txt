Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a clumsy cat named Tom. He loved to play with his favorite toy, a piece of celery.
One day, Tom was playing with his celery when it rolled under the big chair. He tried to get it out, but he was too clumsy. He bumped his head on the chair and said, "Ouch!"
Tom's friend, a little bird named Sally, saw him and asked, "What's wrong, Tom?" Tom told her about his celery under the chair. Sally said, "Let me help you."
Sally flew under the chair and tried to push the celery out. But it was stuck! So, she told Tom, "You need to reverse and pull the chair." Tom did as Sally said, and the chair moved back.
With the chair out of the way, Tom got his celery back. He was so happy! He thanked Sally and they played together all day. And from that day on, Tom was a little less clumsy, thanks to his friend Sally.
