Once upon a time, there was a big nation. In this nation, people loved to sit and talk. One day, a boy named Tom and his friend, Sue, sat under a tree. They talked about fun things.
Tom said, "I feel guilty. I took a cookie from the jar." Sue looked at Tom and said, "I took a cookie too!" They both laughed. They didn't know that something unexpected was about to happen.
Suddenly, a big wind came and blew their cookies away. Tom and Sue were sad. But then, the wind also blew a big bag of cookies right to them. They looked at each other and smiled. They knew they could share the cookies and be happy.
