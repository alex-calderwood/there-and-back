Once upon a time, there was a very attractive cat. The cat had a soft, shiny coat and big, bright eyes. Everyone loved the cat because it was so pretty.
One day, the cat went outside to play. It saw a big puddle and wanted to measure how deep it was. The cat jumped into the puddle, but it was much deeper than it thought.
The cat got very wet and its soft, shiny coat was all dirty. The cat tried to get out of the puddle, but it was too slippery. The cat was stuck in the wet puddle and could not get out. And that was the sad end for the attractive cat.
