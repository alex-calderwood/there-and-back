Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Bella. Bella lived in a small cage. She wanted to escape, but she did not know how.
One day, a wise old cat named Tom came to visit Bella. "Why are you sad?" asked Tom. "I want to escape, but I can't," said Bella. Tom thought for a moment and said, "I have a useful idea. You can break your cage and fly away."
Bella was happy to hear Tom's idea. She used her beak to break the cage. The cage door opened, and Bella flew away. She was free at last! Bella thanked Tom for his useful idea and they became good friends.
