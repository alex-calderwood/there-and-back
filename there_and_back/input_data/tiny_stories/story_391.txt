Once there was a brave doggy who wanted to make a mark in the world. He heard about a line that had been drawn in the sand, and he wanted to see what it was. So one day he ventured out on the adventure of crossing the line. 
The doggy was not sure if he was brave enough, but he wanted to find out what was across the line. He looked carefully and noticed that the line split the ground into two. One side seemed full of danger, but the other held something that excited him.
The brave doggy stepped on the side of danger and started to sniff around. He took a step and hopped over the line. He was scared but he was determined. He was now on the other side of the line.
He quickly realized that there was something special over the line. He looked around and saw that there were delicious treats, a big juicy bone, and a soft and comfy bed. He had found his mark. He was brave enough to cross the line and brave enough to be rewarded.
