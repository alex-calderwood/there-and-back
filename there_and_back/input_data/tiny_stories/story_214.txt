One day, a little girl named Poppy went for a walk in the thick woods. She saw many trees, flowers, and animals. Poppy loved to explore and play in the woods.
As Poppy walked, she saw a small bird on the ground. The bird looked sad and worried. Poppy asked, "Why are you worried, little bird?"
The bird said, "I can't find my mommy. I am lost and I worry I won't see her again." Poppy wanted to help the bird. She said, "Don't worry, little bird. I will help you find your mommy."
Poppy and the bird walked through the thick woods. They asked other animals if they had seen the bird's mommy. Finally, they found the bird's mommy in a tall tree. The bird was so happy and thanked Poppy for her help.
Poppy and the bird became good friends. They played in the woods every day and always looked out for each other. Poppy learned that helping others can make you feel happy too.
