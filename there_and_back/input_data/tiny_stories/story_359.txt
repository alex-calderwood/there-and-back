Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. She liked to play with her toy rope. One day, she went to the park with her mom. At the park, she saw a big tree. She wanted to play with her rope on the tree.
Sally took her rope and tied it to the tree. She pulled the rope slow and it made a swing. Sally was so happy! She asked her mom, "Can I play on the swing?" Her mom said, "Yes, but be careful."
Sally played on the swing all day. She went back and forth, laughing and having fun. When it was time to go home, Sally asked her mom, "Can we come back tomorrow?" Her mom smiled and answered, "Yes, we can come back tomorrow." Sally was so excited to play with her rope swing again.
