Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the yard. They have a ball, a bike, and a kite. They take turns with the toys.
One day, Sara sees a new toy in the yard. It is a big orange truck. It has wheels, a horn, and a shovel. Sara wants to play with the truck. She runs to the truck and picks it up.
"Look, Ben, a truck!" Sara says. "It is orange and shiny. Can I play with it?"
Ben looks at the truck. He likes trucks too. He feels sad. He wants to play with the truck. He shakes his head.
"No, Sara, that is not your truck. That is Tom's truck. Tom is our neighbor. He left his truck in the yard. You have to give it back."
Sara does not want to give back the truck. She likes the truck. She holds the truck tight.
"But I want to play with it, Ben. It is so fun. Please, let me play with it."
Ben thinks for a moment. He wants to be a good friend. He wants to make Sara happy. He has an idea.
"Okay, Sara, you can play with the truck. But only for a little while. Then we have to give it back to Tom. And we have to share the truck. You can have the shovel, and I can have the horn. Deal?"
Sara smiles. She likes Ben's idea. She nods her head.
"Deal, Ben. Thank you for sharing. You are a good friend."
Sara and Ben play with the truck. They have fun. They make noises with the horn and the shovel. They dig and dump dirt. They laugh and giggle.
After a while, they see Tom coming back. He sees his truck in the yard. He looks surprised.
"Hey, that's my truck!" Tom says. "What are you doing with my truck?"
Sara and Ben stop playing. They look at Tom. They feel sorry. They walk to Tom and give him his truck.
"Sorry, Tom, we played with your truck. We hope you don't mind. It is a very nice truck. We like it a lot." Sara says.
"Yeah, sorry, Tom, we didn't mean to take your truck. We just wanted to try it. It is a very cool truck. We had fun with it." Ben says.
Tom looks at Sara and Ben. He sees their faces. They look sincere. He feels happy. He has an idea.
"That's okay, Sara and Ben. I don't mind. You can play with my truck. But only if you let me play with your toys. Can I play with your ball, your bike, and your kite? Deal?"
Sara and Ben look at each other. They smile. They nod their heads.
"Deal, Tom. Thank you for letting us play with your truck. You are a good neighbor."
Tom smiles. He gives them his truck. He takes their toys. They play together. They have fun. They share and accept. They are happy.
