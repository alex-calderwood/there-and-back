Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim and a girl named Sue. They went on a safari with their mom and dad. They saw many animals like big elephants, tall giraffes, and fast lions. Tim and Sue were very happy.
One day, they saw a black bird. The bird was sad because it had no food. Tim and Sue wanted to help the bird. Tim said, "We can share our food with the bird." Sue agreed, "Yes, let's share our food!"
So, Tim and Sue shared their food with the black bird. The bird was very happy and said, "Thank you for sharing!" Tim and Sue smiled and continued their safari adventure. They learned that sharing can make others happy.
