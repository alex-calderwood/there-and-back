Once upon a time, there was a mom and a dad. The mom and dad loved their 3 year-old daughter very much. But the little girl was often very rude. She didn't listen to her mom and dad, and she was mean to her little brother.
One day, when mom and dad were having dinner, the little girl came into the room and started to shout. Mom and dad were very angry, so they told her to go to her room. 
The mom and dad were very disappointed, so they decided to punish her. The dad went to her room and said: "If you're rude again, I will put a lot of smoke in your room".
The little girl was scared, so she started to cry. The dad said: "It's up to you. You can be polite, or I will punish you with smoke".
The little girl knew she had to be good, so she stopped being rude. From then on, she always tried to be nice and friendly.
