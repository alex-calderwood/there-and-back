One day, a little bird named Tim was flying in the park. He saw a big pole and thought it was a nice place to stay. So, Tim went to the pole and stayed there.
A squirrel named Sam came by and saw Tim on the pole. Sam said, "Hi, Tim! Why are you staying on that pole? It's a stupid place to stay." Tim looked at Sam and said, "I like it here. It's not stupid."
Sam and Tim played near the pole all day. They had lots of fun. At the end of the day, Tim said, "You were right, Sam. The pole is a stupid place to stay. Let's find a better place tomorrow." Sam agreed, and they both went to their homes to sleep.
