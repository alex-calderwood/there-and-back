Once upon a time, there was a big field. In the field, there were many animals. There was a fast dog named Max. Max liked to run and play with his friends.
One day, Max saw a little bird. The little bird was hungry. Max wanted to help his new friend. He thought, "I will feed the little bird."
Max found some food for the little bird. He gave the food to the bird. The little bird was happy. Max and the little bird became good friends. They played together in the big field every day.
