Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She loved to sing and dance. One day, Mia heard about a big stage in the park where kids could sing and dance. She was very excited and wanted to go there.
On the day of the show, Mia felt frightened. She was scared to sing and dance in front of many people on the big stage. Her mommy told her it was okay to be scared, but she should try her best. Mia listened to her mommy and decided to be brave.
When it was Mia's turn, she went up on the stage. She started to sing and dance. At first, she missed some words, but she did not stop. She kept singing and dancing. Soon, she felt happy and not frightened anymore. Everyone clapped for her. Mia was so proud of herself for being brave and doing her best on the big stage.
