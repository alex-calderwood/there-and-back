Once upon a time, there was an ancient seal living in a pond. He would often slip around in the water, enjoying the coolness.
One day, a young girl walking along the pond noticed the seal. She bent down to take a closer look when suddenly the seal slipped away.
The girl called out, "Come back here seal! I just want to be your friend."
The seal paused, thinking about the young girl's kind words. He slowly swam back and eventually came to rest at the girl's feet.
The seal looked up at the young girl. In a voice made up of soft squeaks and whistles, the seal said, "Thank you for being my friend!" The girl smiled and stroked the seal's smooth head.
From then on, the ancient seal and the young girl were the best of friends.
