Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a daddy who were cooking in the kitchen. They wanted to make something good. The mommy put some food in the mixer and turned it on.
"Whee!" cried the daddy.
At that moment, their little baby came into the kitchen and saw the mixer. 
"Mine!" he said, and he reached for the mixer.
The mommy quickly moved the mixer away from the baby. "No, this is for cooking," she said. 
The baby looked sad and began to cry. 
The daddy picked him up and hugged him. "It's okay," he said. "Maybe you can help us cook something good!" he added with a smile. 
The baby clapped his hands and was very happy. He helped his parents put food in the mixer and they both cooked something yummy together!
