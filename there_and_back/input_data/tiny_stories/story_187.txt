Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She loved to read books. In her room, there was a big bookshelf full of colorful books.
One day, Amy saw a sweet little cat outside her window. The cat was cute and soft. She wanted to play with it. So, Amy went outside and kneeled down to pet the cat. They became good friends.
Amy wanted to read a book to her new friend. She said, "Cat, let's read a book together!" The cat meowed happily. They went inside and sat near the bookshelf. Amy picked a book with a big red cover. They read the book and had a great time.
