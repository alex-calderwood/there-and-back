Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a white dog named Spot. They liked to play in the park every day.
One day, Tim found a wallet on the ground. He looked inside and saw a picture of a man. Tim said, "We need to find the man and give him his wallet back, Spot!" Spot barked and wagged his tail.
Tim and Spot walked around the park. They saw a man sitting on a bench. Tim asked, "Is this your wallet?" The man looked at the wallet and said, "Yes, thank you!" Tim felt happy that he could help. The man marked a big smiley face on a piece of paper and gave it to Tim. Tim and Spot went home with big smiles on their faces.
