Once upon a time, there were two friends, Jonas and Carl. Jonas was dependable and always kept his promises. Carl was not so dependable. One day, Jonas decided to make a quilt for Carl to show his friendship. He collected many colorful pieces of cloth and carefully cut and sewed them together. Carl saw it and couldn't believe how beautiful it was. So, he decided to demand the quilt of Jonas. But Jonas said, "No, Carl. You need to learn to be dependable before you can receive it." So Carl started to be more careful and trustworthy and followed through on his promises. Finally, Jonas gave him the quilt as a reward for becoming dependable. To this day, Carl cherishes the quilt and remembers to be dependable.
