One day, a cat named Kitty saw a bird outside her window. The bird was slow and Kitty wanted to get it. She jumped up on the window and tried to catch the bird. But the window was closed, so Kitty could not get the bird.
Kitty's friend, Doggy, came into the room and saw Kitty at the window. Doggy asked, "What are you doing, Kitty?" Kitty said, "I want to get the slow bird outside the window."
Doggy had an idea. He opened the door and they both went outside. Kitty tried to get the slow bird, but the bird flew away. Kitty and Doggy laughed and played together in the sun. They had a fun day, even though they did not get the slow bird.
