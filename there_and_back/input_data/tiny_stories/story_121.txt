Once upon a time, there was an elephant who was very serious. He was walking through the forest and he came across a cage. Inside the cage, he saw a small animal in a very sad state. The elephant was very kind and decided to help it. He looked around the cage, searching for the key. After a few minutes, he finally found it. He used it to unlock the cage and he released the animal with a smile.
The animal thanked the elephant for his kind deeds and for showing him such kindness. Then it told the elephant a moral lesson: "Always be kind and helpful to those in need, even if it takes your time and effort".
The elephant was very happy to have received this lesson. He thanked the animal for teaching him about the value of kindness and the importance of helping others in need. He promised himself to always stay kind and generous with those in need. From then on, he never forgot the moral lesson that he learnt from the animal and guided his actions accordingly.
