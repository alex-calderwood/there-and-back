One day, a little boy named Tim went to his mom. "Mom, I want to be rich!" he said. Mom smiled and said, "You can be rich in love and happiness, Tim!" 
Tim thought about it and went to his room. He saw his drawer and opened it. Inside, he found a pinch of magic dust. He was so excited! He took the pinch of magic dust and threw it in the air. 
Suddenly, everything around him changed. His toys turned into gold and his bed became a big, soft cloud. Tim was so happy! He called his mom and showed her the room. "Look, Mom! I am rich now!" he said. Mom laughed and hugged Tim. "Yes, you are rich in love and happiness, my dear," she said.
