One day, a little girl named Lucy found a big lollipop in her room. It was red and sweet. Lucy was very happy. She wanted to eat the lollipop right away. But her mom said, "Lucy, you must eat your lunch first, or the lollipop will spoil your meal."
Lucy did not listen to her mom. She ate the lollipop before her lunch. The lollipop was so sweet that it made her mouth feel funny. Lucy's mom was right. The lollipop spoiled her lunch. She did not want to eat her food anymore.
Later, it was a hot day and Lucy went outside to play. She still had some of the lollipop left. But as she played, the lollipop started to melt in her hand. It became sticky and messy. Lucy was sad. She wished she had listened to her mom. The moral of the story is to listen to your parents and do not let sweet treats spoil your meal.
