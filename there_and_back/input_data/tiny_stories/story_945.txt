Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making noises and pretending to be animals. Tom had a lion toy and Lily had a bunny toy.
"Roar!" Tom said, making his lion toy jump on Lily's bunny toy. "I am the king of the jungle and you are my lunch!"
"No, no, no!" Lily said, pulling her bunny toy away. "You are not nice, Tom. You are mean. Bunnies are nice and they like to hug."
Lily hugged her bunny toy and made a sad face. Tom felt sorry for making Lily sad. He wanted to be nice too.
"Sorry, Lily," Tom said. "I was just playing. Can I hug your bunny too?"
Lily smiled and nodded. She gave Tom her bunny toy and they hugged it together. They felt happy and warm.
"Can I hug you too, Lily?" Tom asked.
"OK, Tom," Lily said. "You are my friend."
They hugged each other and giggled. They were very cute.
But then, they heard a loud noise from the bathroom. It was their big brother, Jake. He had flushed the toilet and it was overflowing. Water was spilling everywhere and making a mess.
"Uh-oh," Jake said. "Mom is going to be mad."
He ran out of the bathroom and saw Tom and Lily hugging in the living room. He had an idea.
"Hey, you two," Jake said. "Do you want to see something cool in the bathroom?"
Tom and Lily let go of each other and looked at Jake. They were curious.
"What is it, Jake?" Tom asked.
"Come and see," Jake said. "But don't tell Mom."
He grabbed Tom and Lily by their hands and dragged them to the bathroom. He pushed them inside and locked the door behind them.
"Ha, ha, ha!" Jake said. "Now you are stuck in the bathroom with the water. Have fun!"
He ran away and left Tom and Lily alone. They saw the water on the floor and the toilet still overflowing. They were scared and wet.
"Help, help!" Tom and Lily cried. "Let us out, Jake! Let us out!"
But Jake did not hear them. He was hiding in his room. He was not nice. He was mean.
Tom and Lily hugged each other and cried. They wished they were still playing with their toys in the living room. They were not happy. They were sad.
The end.
