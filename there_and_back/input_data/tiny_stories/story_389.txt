Once upon a time, in a small room, there was a smelly eraser. This eraser had a big secret. It could unlock a magic door. The eraser lived with a little boy named Tim.
One day, Tim found the eraser and wanted to draw. He saw the magic door and tried to open it, but it was locked. Then, he remembered the smelly eraser. He used the eraser to unlock the magic door.
When the door opened, a big monster came out. The monster was not nice. It made a big mess in Tim's room. Tim tried to stop the monster, but he could not. The monster left and Tim's room was very messy. Tim was sad because he had to clean up the big mess.
