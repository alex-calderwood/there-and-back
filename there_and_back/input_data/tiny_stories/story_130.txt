Once upon a time there was a young mole who was picking flowers in the garden. She liked to pick the pretty yellow and pink ones best. She gathered them into a big bunch and held them gently in her paws.
Suddenly the young mole heard a noise! She turned around and saw a little girl. The girl had the same yellow and pink flowers in her hands. She smiled and pointed to the flowers.
The two of them were friends now. The young mole gave her friend some of her flowers and they had a lot of fun together. They played and ran around in the garden all day.
At the end of the day, the girl thanked the young mole and gave her a hug. Then she picked the remaining flowers and waved goodbye. The young mole was sad to see her go, but she was glad to have met her. Now their friendship will last forever!
