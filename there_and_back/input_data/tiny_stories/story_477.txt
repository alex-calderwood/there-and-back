One day, a little boy named Tim found a tie on the floor. He didn't know what it was, so he asked his mom. His mom said it was a tie and that it was for big people to wear. Tim wanted to wear the tie too, but his mom said he was too little.
Tim felt sad and started to complain. He didn't like being told he was too little. He wanted to show his mom that he could wear the tie too. So, Tim put the tie around his neck and tried to make it look nice. But he didn't know how to do it, and it looked funny.
His mom saw him and laughed. She said, "Tim, you are a little ignorant about ties, but that's okay. You will learn when you are bigger." Tim smiled and knew that one day, he would wear a tie just like the big people.
