Anna liked to play with her pet fish, Finn. She had a big bowl with water and rocks and plants for Finn to swim in. She would talk to Finn and feed him little flakes every day.
One day, Anna's mom said they were going to visit grandma. Anna wanted to take Finn with her, so she put him in a small bowl with some water and a lid. She carried the bowl carefully in the car.
"Are you okay, Finn?" Anna asked. "Do you like the car?"
Finn did not answer. He looked scared and sad. He did not swim much. He just stayed at the bottom of the bowl.
Anna's mom saw that Finn was not happy. She said, "Anna, I know you love Finn, but he is not comfortable in the small bowl. He needs more space and air and fresh water. He will be happier if we release him in the pond near grandma's house. There are many other fish there that he can play with. What do you think?"
Anna thought for a moment. She loved Finn, but she did not want him to be sad. She said, "Okay, mom. Let's release Finn in the pond. Maybe he will make some friends there."
They arrived at grandma's house and walked to the pond. Anna's mom helped her open the lid and gently pour the water and Finn into the pond. Finn swam away quickly, then turned around and looked at Anna. He seemed to say thank you and goodbye.
Anna waved at Finn and smiled. She said, "Bye, Finn. Have fun in the pond. I will miss you, but I'm glad you are comfortable."
