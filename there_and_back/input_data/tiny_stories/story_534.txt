Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to wear his red hat. He felt safe when he wore it. One day, Tim found a trumpet in his room. It was big and shiny.
Tim wanted to play the trumpet, but he didn't know how. He asked his mom, "Mom, can you teach me to play the trumpet?" His mom smiled and said, "Of course, Tim! Let's learn together."
They practiced every day. Tim wore his red hat while playing the trumpet. He felt safe and happy. Soon, Tim and his mom were very good at playing the trumpet. They played songs for their family and friends, and everyone loved it.
