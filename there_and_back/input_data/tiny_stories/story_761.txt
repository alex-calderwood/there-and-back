Once upon a time, there was a popular boy named Tim. He had a big, shiny helmet that he loved to wear. Everyone in his town liked to see Tim in his helmet.
One day, Tim did something bad. He took a toy from his friend, Sam. Sam was sad and told his mom. Tim's mom found out and she had to punish him.
Tim's mom said, "You can't wear your helmet for a whole day." Tim was very sad. He said sorry to Sam and gave the toy back. From that day on, Tim was always nice to his friends.
