Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a big toy box in his room. He liked to store all his toys in the box when he was done playing. One day, Tim's mom asked him to put his toys away. "Tim, please store your toys in the box," she said.
Tim started to put his toys away, but then he felt a pain in his foot. He looked down and saw that he stepped on a toy car. "Ouch!" he cried. His mom came running to see what happened. "What's wrong, Tim?" she asked.
"I have pain in my foot. I stepped on a toy car," Tim said, tears in his eyes. His mom looked at the toy car, which was now far away from Tim's foot. "That toy car is distant now, but we need to be more careful when we store our toys, so we don't get hurt," she told him. Tim agreed, and they put away the rest of the toys together, making sure there were no more accidents.
