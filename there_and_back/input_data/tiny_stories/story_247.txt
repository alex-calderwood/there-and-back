Once upon a time, there was a big gorilla named Gigi. Gigi was different from other gorillas because she had blue fur. Gigi lived in a big forest with many trees.
One day, Gigi met a little bird named Bobo. Bobo said, "Hi Gigi, why is your fur different?" Gigi smiled and said, "I don't know, but I like it." Bobo liked Gigi's fur too, and they became friends.
Gigi and Bobo played together every day. They liked to climb trees and eat fruit. Sometimes, Gigi would remember to bring fruit for Bobo. They were happy and loved to laugh. Gigi and Bobo were the best of friends.
