Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was a bit nervous because it was his first time to deliver yogurt to his friend, Sue. Tim put the yogurt in a small bag and walked to Sue's house.
When Tim got to Sue's house, he knocked on the door. Sue opened the door and said, "Hi Tim! What do you have in the bag?" Tim said, "I have yogurt for you, Sue!" Sue was very happy and thanked Tim for bringing the yogurt.
After Sue got the yogurt, they both sat down and ate the yogurt together. Tim was not nervous anymore because he had fun with his friend. They laughed and played until it was time for Tim to go home. Tim was happy that he could deliver the yogurt to Sue and make her smile.
