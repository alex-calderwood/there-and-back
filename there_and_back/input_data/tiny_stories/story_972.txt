Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a leopard named Leo. Leo was not very fast and he wanted to improve. He had many friends in the forest, but he was not as fast as them. He felt sad.
One day, Leo met a wise old turtle named Tim. Leo asked Tim, "How can I improve and be fast like my friends?" Tim smiled and said, "You must be fair to yourself and practice every day."
So, Leo started to practice running every day. He ran up hills and through the trees. Day by day, Leo began to improve. He became faster and faster. His friends cheered for him and were happy for him.
In the end, Leo became the fastest leopard in the forest. He was very proud of himself and thankful to Tim for his help. Leo learned that with hard work and being fair to himself, he could improve and be the best he could be.
