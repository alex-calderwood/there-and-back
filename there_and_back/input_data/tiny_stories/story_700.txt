Mommy and Daddy were sitting on the porch, looking out at the garden. Mommy was looking at the invitation she was holding.
"What is it, Mommy?" asked Adam, the 3-year-old.
"It's an invitation," Mommy said.
Adam leaned forward to get a better look.
"To what?" he asked.
"To Grandma and Grandpa's house. They are having a party," said Mommy.
Adam's eyes lit up and he smiled.
"Can I go? Please!" he asked.
"Of course, you can go," said Daddy. "That's why Mommy and I are discussing it. We have to decide when to go."
Mommy and Daddy talked for a while and then Daddy said, "We will go on Saturday morning. That is wise, so you can have time to play."
Adam nodded eagerly. He was so happy to have an invitation to Grandma and Grandpa's house.
