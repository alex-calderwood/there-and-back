Once upon a time, in a wide green park, there lived a big red ball. The ball was very happy because it had many friends. They liked to play with the ball every day. The ball would zip around the park, bouncing and rolling with joy.
One day, a mean boy came to the park. He saw the big red ball and wanted to steal it. So, when no one was looking, he took the ball and ran away. The ball was very sad and missed its friends.
The friends knew they had to help the big red ball. They made a plan to get the ball back from the mean boy. They all worked together and soon, the big red ball was free. The mean boy learned not to steal, and the ball went back to zipping around the wide green park with its friends. They all lived happily ever after.
