One day, a little girl named Mia went to the park to play. She loved to play on the swings, slide, and in the sand. Mia was very intelligent and always remembered to bring her toys.
While playing, Mia met a boy named Tom. They decided to play together. Mia said, "Let's play with my toys!" Tom was excited and replied, "Yes, let's play!"
But when Mia went to get her toys, she realized she forgot them at home. "Oh no, I forgot my toys!" she said. Tom thought for a moment and said, "That's okay, we can still play without toys."
Just then, a big, friendly dog appeared in the park. The dog wanted to play too! Mia and Tom were surprised and happy. They played with the dog all day long, and they didn't need any toys. In the end, they had the best day ever, even though Mia forgot her toys.
