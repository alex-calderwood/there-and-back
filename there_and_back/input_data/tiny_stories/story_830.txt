Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the garden with their dog, Spot. One day, they see a big flower in the garden. It is yellow and red and has many petals.
"Wow, look at the flower!" Sara says. "It is so pretty!"
"Yes, it is!" Ben agrees. "It is a sunflower. It blooms in the summer."
They go closer to the flower and see a bee on it. The bee is busy and makes a buzzing sound.
"Hello, bee!" Sara says. "Do you like the flower?"
The bee does not answer. It flies away to another flower.
"Be careful, Sara!" Ben says. "The bee can sting you. It has a staff on its back. It is tough and sharp."
"I know, Ben," Sara says. "But the bee is nice. It helps the flowers grow. It makes honey for us."
They hear their mom calling them from the house.
"Come on, kids!" Mom says. "It is time for lunch. We have sandwiches and juice and cookies for you."
"Yay!" Sara and Ben say. They run to the house with Spot. They love their mom and their garden. They are happy.
