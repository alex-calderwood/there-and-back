Once upon a time, there was a loyal bird named Sam. Sam had big wings. He loved to fly high in the sky.
One day, Sam saw a little girl named Sue. Sue was sad. She had lost her toy. "I will help you find your toy," Sam said. Sue was happy. They looked for the toy together.
As they looked, Sam's wing hit a wet rock. He slipped and fell. "Are you okay?" Sue asked. "Yes, I am fine," Sam said. They kept looking. Soon, they found the toy. Sue was very happy. She hugged Sam and thanked him. From that day on, Sam and Sue were the best of friends.
