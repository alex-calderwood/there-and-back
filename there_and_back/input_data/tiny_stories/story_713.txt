One day, a busy cat named Tom was walking in his yard. He saw his friend, a dog named Max. Max was always running around and playing. They liked to play together.
"Max, do you want to play?" Tom asked. "Yes, let's play!" Max said. They started to play, but then something strange happened. Tom found a big red button on the ground. It said "reverse". Tom pushed the button.
Suddenly, everything went backwards! Tom and Max were not playing anymore. They were going back in time. They saw their old games and toys. They were watching their own history.
Tom and Max were scared. They did not know what to do. Then, they saw the red button again. Tom pushed it one more time. Everything went back to normal. Tom and Max were happy to be back in their yard. They played together all day, and they never touched the red button again.
