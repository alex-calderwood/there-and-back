One day, a noisy leopard named Leo came to play. He loved to jump and run. He was very fast and loud. Leo saw a little boy named Tim. Tim was playing with a red ball.
"Hi Tim, can I come play with you?" asked Leo the noisy leopard. Tim smiled and said, "Yes, Leo! Let's play together."
They played all day long. They ran, jumped, and laughed. Leo was very noisy, but Tim didn't mind. They were having so much fun.
As the sun went down, it was time for Leo to go home. Tim said, "Bye, Leo! Come play again soon!" Leo the noisy leopard smiled and said, "I will, Tim!" And off he went, back to his home in the trees.
