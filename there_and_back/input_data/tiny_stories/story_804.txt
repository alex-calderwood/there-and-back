Once upon a time there was a mighty lion, king of his jungle. He roamed the yellow grass, alone and proud.
One day, a brave rabbit hopped into the lion's kingdom, wearing a cap on his head. The lion thought the rabbit was very brave and the two quickly became friends. 
The rabbit asked if he could bite the mighty lion's tail, to show his powerful friend just how brave he was. The lion said yes!
But when the rabbit took a bite of the mighty lion's tail, it hurt! The lion roared in pain and the rabbit was scared.
The rabbit quickly apologized for hurting the lion and promised never to bite him again. The lion understood and told the rabbit that it was okay and that friends should never hurt each other on purpose.
Moral of the story: Friends should never hurt each other on purpose.
