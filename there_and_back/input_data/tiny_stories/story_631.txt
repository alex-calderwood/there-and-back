Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack. Jack liked to print things. One day, Jack had an unusual idea. He wanted to print a pizza.
Jack found a picture of a pizza. He put the picture in his printer. Jack pressed the button, and the printer made a noise. Out came the picture of the pizza. Jack was happy.
Jack showed the picture to his mom. She laughed, and said, "That's not a real pizza, Jack!" Jack knew it was just a picture, but he still liked it. Jack put the picture on his wall, and every time he looked at it, he thought about the unusual pizza he printed.
