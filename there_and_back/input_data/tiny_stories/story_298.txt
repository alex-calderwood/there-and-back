Once upon a time, there was a funny car named Bumpy. Bumpy was different from other cars because he could talk and laugh. Bumpy loved to make his friends laugh too.
One day, Bumpy was playing with his friend, a little girl named Amy. Amy said, "Bumpy, you need fuel to go fast!" Bumpy replied, "Yes, Amy! Fuel makes me go zoom!" They both laughed and played together, racing around the yard.
As they played, Bumpy and Amy saw a big tree. Bumpy said, "Let's race to the tree!" They raced, and Bumpy won. They both laughed and had so much fun. Bumpy and Amy were happy to be different and loved their special friendship.
