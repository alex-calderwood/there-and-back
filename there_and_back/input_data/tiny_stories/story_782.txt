Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Bobo. Bobo was an independent dog who loved to play and get dirty. One day, Bobo found a big knot in a rope. He wanted to untie it, but it was very hard.
Bobo's friend, a cat named Mimi, saw him trying to untie the knot. Mimi said, "Let me help you, Bobo." They worked together and soon, the knot was gone. Bobo was so happy that he jumped and played with the rope.
Suddenly, Bobo's mom came and saw how dirty he was. She said, "Bobo, you need to bathe now." Bobo did not like to bathe, but he knew he had to. While he was in the water, he found a shiny toy that he had lost a long time ago. Bobo was so happy and now he loved to bathe.
