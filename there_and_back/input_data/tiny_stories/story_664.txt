Once upon a time there was a friend named Amy. She loved to play make believe and climb tall trees. She had a big, fluffy dog named Fluffy who always followed her around.
One day, Amy wanted to explore a big lake so she went by herself. She swam really far and wondered what was below her feet. She wanted to go deeper but was afraid. 
Amy thought about what she had been told about the lake: it was too deep and dangerous to explore. But Amy wanted to trust the lake and believed that it was her anchor and she could explore safely.
But then, something crazy happened. As she swam deeper, Amy felt a big wave of water come over her. She was scared and started to swim back to shore. But the wave was too strong and pushed Amy away! She was so scared that she started to cry.
But then, Amy heard a voice. It was Fluffy. He had followed her to the lake and swam out to help her. "Trust me,Amy," he said. His big, fluffy paws pulled and pushed Amy back to the shore. 
Amy was so happy that she and Fluffy had this special moment together. From that day forward she trusted Fluffy with her life.
