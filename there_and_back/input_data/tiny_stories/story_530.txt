Once there was a little girl, her name was Lucy. She was very excited because today was special. She decided to shout with joy to show her happiness.
Carrying a present in her hands, she ran as fast as she could to her house. When she reached her house, she was out of breath. But even so, she shouted with excitement when she entered her livingroom.
There, she saw a new television. It was modest, but it was still very special to her. She was so happy that she started to jump in the air and shout even louder!
As she opened the box, she saw that it was even better than what she had expected. She ran to hug her mother and shouted even louder with joy and excitement.
And so it was that Lucy's special day was made even more special by her new modest television.
