Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a famous dog named Max. Max was famous because he could do a funny dance in his pants. Everyone loved to watch Max dance.
One day, Max met a little girl named Amy. Amy said, "Max, I want to watch you dance in your pants!" Max was happy to show Amy his dance. So, Max put on his pants and started to dance for Amy. Amy laughed and clapped her hands.
But, while Max was dancing, a big wind came. The wind blew Max's pants away. Max tried to catch his pants, but he could not. Max was very sad. Now, Max could not dance in his pants anymore, and nobody could watch him. Max was not famous anymore, and he missed his pants.
