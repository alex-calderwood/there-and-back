Once upon a time, there was a friendly bear named Bob. One beautiful summer day, Bob was walking through the forest when he heard a noise. He looked around and saw a baby rabbit hopping around his feet. 
Bob smiled and said, "Hi there! What's your name?"
The baby rabbit replied, "My name is Toby!" 
Bob said, "That's a lovely name. Would you like to play together?" 
Toby jumped up and down with excitement and said, "Yes, please!" 
Bob smiled, and offered his big friendly foot to Toby to climb on. Toby hopped onto Bob's foot, and they ran and played together. 
They laughed and played all day until it was time to go home. Bob and Toby said goodbye and promised to play together soon.
