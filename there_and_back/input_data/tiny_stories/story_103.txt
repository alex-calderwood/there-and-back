Lily and Ben like to play in the park. They like to swing, run and climb. But their favorite thing is the slide. The slide is big and shiny and fast.
One day, it rains a lot. The park is wet and muddy. Lily and Ben put on their boots and coats and go to the park anyway. They want to slide.
But when they get to the slide, they see something scary. The slide is not shiny anymore. It is dark and dirty. And there is a big puddle at the bottom. The slide is soaked.
Lily and Ben are afraid. They do not want to slide. They think they will get wet and dirty and cold. They want to go home.
But then they see a dog. The dog is happy. He runs to the slide and jumps on it. He slides down and splashes in the puddle. He shakes his fur and barks. He does it again and again.
Lily and Ben watch the dog. They see that he is having fun. He is not scared of the slide. He likes to be soaked.
Lily and Ben smile. They think maybe the slide is not so scary after all. They decide to try it. They climb up and slide down. They splash in the puddle. They laugh and shout. They do it again and again.
They have fun. They do not mind being soaked. They like the slide. They like the rain. They like the dog. They are happy.
