Timmy was very excited. Today his parents took him to the park. They walked through the gate and instantly Timmy felt powerful. He got to run around, swing and slide on the floor. His parents watched him the whole time making sure he was having a good time.
Timmy went to a basketball hoop with a small ball and tried to throw it in. After many fails, he finally did it and laughed with happiness as he high-fived his dad. He felt so powerful! Suddenly an idea crossed his mind. He asked his parents to go hide in the bushes and then called everyone in the park to come and see him.
Everyone gathered around him and he proudly showed them his powerful throwing technique. All the kids clapped and cheered for him and his parents were very proud. Timmy couldn't believe it! His happy day at the park had just become even better.
