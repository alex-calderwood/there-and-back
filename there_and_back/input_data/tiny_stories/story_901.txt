Lily likes to draw pictures with her crayons. She draws her family, her dog, her house and her flowers. She wants to share her pictures with her grandma, who lives far away. She asks her mom to help her mail her pictures to grandma.
Mom helps Lily put her pictures in a big envelope. She writes grandma's name and address on the front. She puts a stamp on the corner. She says, "Now we can mail your pictures to grandma. She will be very happy to see them."
Lily and mom walk to the mailbox. Lily holds the envelope in her hand. She is very excited. She sees the mailbox. It is red and blue and has a flag on the side. Mom says, "Lift the flag and put the envelope inside. Then lower the flag. That means the mailman will come and take your pictures to grandma."
Lily does what mom says. She lifts the flag and puts the envelope inside. She lowers the flag. She smiles. She says, "Bye bye, pictures. Have a good trip to grandma." She hops on one leg. She is very proud of herself. She says, "I mailed my pictures to grandma. I am a big girl."
Mom hugs Lily. She says, "You are a big girl. And a very good artist. Grandma will love your pictures. And she will love you more." She kisses Lily on the cheek. They walk back home. Lily sings a song. She is happy. She mailed her pictures to grandma.
