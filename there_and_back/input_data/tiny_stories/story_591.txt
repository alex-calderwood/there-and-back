Once, there was a girl named Sue. Sue had a box. In the box, she had a stamp. The stamp was big and red. Sue liked to use the stamp on her drawings.
One day, Sue's friend Tom came over. Tom saw the stamp and said, "Can I use the stamp too?" Sue said, "Yes, but it is difficult. I will help you." Sue and Tom used the stamp together. They made lots of fun drawings.
After they finished, Sue's mom came in. She saw the drawings and said, "Wow! You both did a great job!" Sue and Tom were happy. They played with the stamp all day.
