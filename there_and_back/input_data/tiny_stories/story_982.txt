Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sally. Sally loved to play outside in the sun. One day, her mom gave her a healthy snack and a bottle of water to take with her. She told Sally, "Drink your water so you stay strong and healthy."
Sally went outside to play with her friends. They were having so much fun! They ran and jumped and laughed. Sally's mom came outside and saw them playing. She warned them, "Don't forget to drink your water from the bottle!"
Sally and her friends listened to her mom. They took a break and drank their water. They felt much better and continued to play. Sally knew her mom was right. Drinking water from the bottle helped them stay strong and healthy. And they played happily ever after.
