Once upon a time, there was a little beetle. He lived in a gloomy forest. He had many friends, like birds, ants, and squirrels. But the beetle was sad because he was dirty.
One day, a nice frog came to the beetle. The frog said, "Let's go bathe in the pond!" The beetle was happy and went with the frog. They jumped and splashed in the water. The beetle felt clean and shiny.
After their bath, the beetle and the frog played with their friends in the forest. The gloomy forest was not so gloomy anymore. The beetle was very happy and felt loved by all his friends. And from that day on, the beetle and the frog always bathed together in the pond.
