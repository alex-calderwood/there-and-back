Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy was playing in her room with her toys. She saw her mom's scissors on the table. She knew she should not touch them, but she wanted to play with them.
Amy's mom walked into the room and saw Amy looking at the scissors. She said, "Amy, do not touch the scissors. They can hurt you. Let's play with your doll instead." Amy nodded, but she still wanted to play with the scissors.
Later, when her mom was not looking, Amy grabbed the scissors. She started to pull them open and closed. Suddenly, she felt dizzy and fell down. The scissors fell too, but they did not hurt her.
Amy's mom heard the noise and ran into the room. She saw Amy on the floor and the scissors next to her. "Amy, I told you not to play with the scissors! Are you okay?" she asked. Amy nodded, feeling a little better.
From that day on, Amy never touched the scissors again. She learned to listen to her mom and play with her toys. And she never felt dizzy again.
