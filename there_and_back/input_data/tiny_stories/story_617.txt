Ben likes to count. He can count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. He is very proud of his counting. He wants to show his mom.
"Mom, look, I can count!" Ben says. He holds up his fingers and counts them. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!"
Mom smiles and hugs Ben. "You are very good at counting, Ben. You are a smart boy."
"Thank you, mom. But what comes after nine?" Ben asks. He wants to learn more.
Mom thinks for a moment. She has an idea. She takes a paper and a pen. She draws a circle on the paper. "This is zero, Ben. Zero is nothing. It is empty. It is like no fingers."
Ben looks at the circle. He is curious. "Zero? How do you count with zero?"
Mom shows Ben how to write zero next to nine. "This is ten, Ben. Ten is one and zero. It is like one finger and no fingers. Do you see?"
Ben nods. He tries to write ten on the paper. He copies mom's zero. "Ten! I can count to ten!"
Mom claps and cheers. "You did it, Ben! You learned zero. You can count to ten. You are very good at learning, Ben. I am proud of you."
Ben smiles and hugs mom. He is happy. He learned something new. He wants to count more. "Can you teach me more, mom?"
Mom nods. She is happy too. She loves to teach Ben. She takes another paper and a pen. She draws another circle next to ten. "This is eleven, Ben. Eleven is one and one. It is like one finger and one finger. Do you want to try?"
Ben nods. He takes the pen and writes eleven on the paper. He counts with his fingers. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven! I can count to eleven!"
Mom and Ben laugh and hug. They have fun counting. They learn more numbers. They are a good team.
