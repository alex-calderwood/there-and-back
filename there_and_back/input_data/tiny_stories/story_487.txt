One day, a little girl named Sue found a razor. She did not know what it was, so she showed it to her mom. Her mom said, "This is not a toy, Sue. It is not good for kids. Give it to me, please." Sue gave the razor to her mom.
Later that day, Sue saw her dad pray. She asked, "Dad, what are you doing?" Her dad said, "I am praying, Sue. It is when we talk to God and ask for help or say thank you." Sue thought it was a good idea, so she prayed too.
The next day, Sue's mom could not find the razor. She looked everywhere. Then, she saw Sue praying. Sue said, "Mom, I prayed for the razor to go away because it is not good for kids." Her mom smiled and said, "That was a good thing to do, Sue. Thank you for keeping us safe."
