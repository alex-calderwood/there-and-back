Once upon a time, in a cold land, there was a powerful bear. The bear lived in a big igloo. He was very strong and all the animals knew him.
One day, a small rabbit came to the bear's igloo. The rabbit was very sad. He wanted to be powerful like the bear. The bear saw the rabbit and asked, "Why are you sad, little rabbit?"
The rabbit said, "I want to be powerful like you, bear. Then, I can be happy." The bear thought for a moment and said, "Being powerful is not what makes you happy, little rabbit. It is being kind and helping others."
The rabbit listened to the bear and decided to help his friends. He shared his food and played with them. Soon, the rabbit was happy, and all the animals loved him. The rabbit learned that being kind is better than being powerful.
