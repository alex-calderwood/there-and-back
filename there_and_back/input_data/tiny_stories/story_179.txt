One day, a little girl named Mia went to the beach with her mom. Mia loved the beach. She loved the sand, the water, and the sun. Mia saw a dolphin in the water. The dolphin was jumping and playing. Mia was very happy to see the dolphin.
Mia wanted to play with the dolphin, but her mom said, "No, Mia. The dolphin is too far away." Mia was stubborn. She tried to go in the water, but her mom held her hand tight. Mia could not go to the dolphin.
Mia was sad. She looked at the dolphin and said, "I want to play with you." The dolphin heard Mia and swam closer. Mia and the dolphin played in the water. They laughed and had fun. Mia's mom watched them and smiled. The dolphin was not stubborn, and Mia was happy.
