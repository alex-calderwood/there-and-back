Tom and Lily were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make different dishes. They found some bottles and jars on the shelf and decided to mix them together.
"What are you making, Tom?" Lily asked.
"I'm making a soup. It has water, salt, sugar, vinegar, and ketchup. Do you want some?" Tom said.
Lily looked at the red liquid in the pot. It smelled bad. She shook her head. "No, thank you. I'm making a cake. It has flour, milk, eggs, butter, and honey. Do you want some?" Lily said.
Tom looked at the yellow batter in the bowl. It looked good. He nodded. "Yes, please. Can I help you?" Tom said.
Lily smiled. She gave Tom a spoon and said, "You can stir the batter. But be careful, don't spill it."
Tom took the spoon and stirred the batter. He liked the sound it made. He wondered how it would taste. He licked the spoon. It was sweet and creamy. He liked it. He licked the spoon again. And again.
Lily saw Tom licking the spoon. She was angry. She said, "Tom, stop it! That's not for licking. That's for baking. You're ruining the cake. And you're making a mess."
Tom didn't listen. He liked the batter too much. He said, "Lily, don't be silly. This is not a cake. This is a poison. It will make you sick. And I'm not making a mess. I'm making a masterpiece."
Lily was scared. She said, "Tom, what are you talking about? This is not a poison. This is a cake. It will make you happy. And you are making a mess. You're spilling the batter everywhere."
Tom didn't care. He said, "Lily, you're ignorant. You don't know anything. This is a poison. It will make you sad. And I'm not spilling the batter. I'm decorating the kitchen."
Lily was sad. She said, "Tom, you're mean. You don't care about me. This is a cake. It will make you glad. And you're spilling the batter. You're ruining the kitchen."
Tom and Lily kept arguing. They didn't notice the smoke coming from the pot. They didn't notice the fire starting on the stove. They didn't notice the alarm ringing in the house. They didn't notice the mom and dad running into the kitchen. They only noticed when the mom and dad grabbed them and took them outside. They only noticed when the mom and dad scolded them and hugged them. They only noticed when the mom and dad said, "You're lucky. You could have been hurt. You could have burned the house. You could have eaten the poison. You could have died."
Tom and Lily were sorry. They said, "We're sorry. We were playing. We were mixing. We were ignorant."
The mom and dad said, "We know. We love you. But don't ever do that again. Don't ever play with fire. Don't ever mix things you don't know. Don't ever eat things you don't trust. Don't ever be ignorant."
