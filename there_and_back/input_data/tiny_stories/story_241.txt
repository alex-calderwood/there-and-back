One day, Bob went fishing by the lake. He was hoping to catch some fish for dinner. As soon as he dropped his line into the water, he felt a tug. He was sure there was a fish on the other end.
Bob was so excited, he was about to let out a shout, when he heard someone nearby shouting. He looked up and saw another boy with a fishing rod by the lake.
The other boy said: "That fish is mine. I saw it first. Give it back!" Bob was very surprised.
Bob said: "That's not very nice. It's not selfish to share."
The other boy said: "I don't care. I want that fish." He crossed his arms and wouldn't move.
Bob then had an idea. He said: "How about this. I'll give you the fish if you give me 5 mineral rocks in return."
The other boy looked shocked but agreed. He gave Bob 5 minerals and Bob handed him the fish.
Bob was very pleased with how he handled the situation and went home happy with his catch and his minerals.
