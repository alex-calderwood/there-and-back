Once upon a time, there was a cold day. A boy named Tim and his dog, Spot, went for a walk. They wore warm clothes and played in the snow. They made a big snowman with a hat and a big smile.
They saw a house with a warm fire. Tim said, "Let's go inside and get warm." Inside the house, they saw a man named Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown was writing a letter with ink. The ink was black and wet.
Mr. Brown said, "Be careful not to touch the ink or it will make a mess." Tim and Spot sat by the fire to get warm. They watched the fire burn and felt happy. They thanked Mr. Brown and went back outside to play in the snow.
