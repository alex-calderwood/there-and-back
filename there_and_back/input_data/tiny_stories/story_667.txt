Once upon a time, in a mild and sunny land, there was a big red door. The door was always open, and all the animals loved to play around it. One day, a small mouse named Tim and a big cat named Sam were playing near the door.
"Let's close the door and play inside," said Tim. Sam agreed, and they closed the door. But then, they heard a loud knock. It was their friend, a dog named Max.
"Open the door! It's time for me to play too," Max barked from outside. But Tim and Sam did not want to share their fun space with Max. They wanted to keep the door closed.
Max felt sad and left. The next day, Tim and Sam opened the door and saw Max playing with new friends. Tim and Sam realized that it was not nice to close the door on their friend. They said they were sorry, and Max forgave them. From that time on, they always kept the door open and played together, sharing the fun with all their friends.
