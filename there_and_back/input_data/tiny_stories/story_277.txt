Once upon a time, a little cat named Sam was walking in the woods. He was feeling fearful because he had never been this far from home. The sun was hot, and Sam was thirsty.
Sam saw a big house in the woods. He thought maybe they would welcome him and give him some water. So he walked up to the door and knocked. A big dog opened the door, and Sam was very scared.
But the big dog was very kind. He welcomed Sam into the house and gave him water. The dog and cat became best friends, and Sam was not fearful anymore. They played together in the woods every day, and Sam learned that unexpected things can be good.
