Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with books. They have many books with pictures and stories. One day, they find a big book in the attic. The book has no pictures, only words. The words are weird. Tom and Sam do not know what they mean.
"Look at this book, Sam. It is boring. Let's make it fun," Tom says.
He takes a page and rips it. He makes a paper plane with the page. He throws the plane in the air. Sam laughs and claps.
"I want to make a plane too," Sam says.
He takes another page and rips it. He makes a paper plane with the page. He throws the plane in the air. Tom and Sam have fun with their planes. They rip more pages and make more planes. They destroy the book.
But the book is not a normal book. It is a magic book. The book is angry. The book makes a loud noise. The book shakes and glows. The book sends the paper planes back to Tom and Sam. The paper planes hit them and hurt them. Tom and Sam cry and run away.
"Help, help! The book is mad at us!" Tom and Sam shout.
Mom and Dad hear them and come to the attic. They see the book and the paper planes. They are shocked.
"What have you done, boys? This book is very old and special. It belongs to your grandpa. He gave it to us before he died. He said it has magic powers. You should not destroy it. You should respect it," Mom says.
"We are sorry, Mom. We did not know. We just wanted to play. The book is weird. It attacked us," Tom says.
"We are sorry, Dad. We did not mean to hurt the book. We were curious. The book has weird words. We could not read them," Sam says.
Mom and Dad hug them and calm them down. They tell them to apologize to the book. They tell them to be careful with books. They tell them to learn to read. They tell them to love books.
Tom and Sam say sorry to the book. They promise to be good. They promise to read. They promise to love books.
The book hears them and forgives them. The book stops making noise. The book stops shaking and glowing. The book puts the pages back together. The book closes and sleeps.
The end.
