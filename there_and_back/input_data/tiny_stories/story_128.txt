One day, a little seal was swimming in the big blue sea. The sea was peaceful and calm. The seal liked to relax and play with his friends in the water.
One day, while the seal was relaxing, something unexpected happened. A big fish came near the seal. The big fish wanted to play with the seal too. The seal was scared at first, but then he saw that the big fish was nice.
The seal and the big fish became friends. They played together in the peaceful sea. The seal was happy to have a new friend. And now, the seal could relax and have fun with both his old friends and his new big fish friend.
