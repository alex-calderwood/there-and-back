Once upon a time, there was a chubby cat named Max. Max loved to play with water. One day, Max saw a faucet in the kitchen. Max was very curious about the faucet.
Max went to the faucet to examine it. He looked at it and touched it with his paw. Water started to come out of the faucet. Max was very happy and started to play with the water.
Max played with the water all day. He splashed and jumped in the water. At the end of the day, Max was very wet but he had a lot of fun. Max loved the faucet and played with it every day.
