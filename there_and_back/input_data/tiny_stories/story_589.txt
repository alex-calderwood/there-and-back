One day, Tim found a great box in his room. He could not resist to open it. Inside the box, there was a stamp. The stamp had a picture of a big, happy sun. Tim was very happy to find the stamp.
Tim took the stamp and went to his friend, Lily. He showed her the great stamp. Lily liked the stamp too. They both wanted to play with it. They decided to share the stamp and have fun together.
Tim and Lily took turns using the stamp. They stamped pictures of the big, happy sun on paper. They made many sun pictures and put them on their walls. The great stamp made them very happy. They played with the stamp all day and had a lot of fun.
