One day, a little shrimp was swimming in the sea. The shrimp was very small and poor. He had no friends to play with. He felt very sad.
One sunny day, the shrimp saw a big fish. The big fish was pointing at something. The shrimp swam closer to see what it was. The big fish was pointing at a beautiful shell.
The shrimp and the big fish started to play with the shell. They had a lot of fun. The poor shrimp was not sad anymore. He had found a friend in the big fish. They played together every day, and the shrimp was very happy.
