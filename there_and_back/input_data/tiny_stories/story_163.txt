Once upon a time, there was a little white cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to play with her toy laser. One day, Fluffy set the laser on the floor and it started to move. Fluffy chased the laser all around the room. She was having so much fun!
Soon, Fluffy's friend, a small brown dog named Buddy, came over to play. Buddy saw the laser and wanted to chase it too. But Fluffy did not want to share her toy. Buddy felt sad and went to sit in the corner.
Fluffy saw how sad Buddy was and thought about it. She decided to share her laser with Buddy. They both played with the laser and had a great time. In the end, Fluffy learned that sharing with friends is more fun than playing alone.
