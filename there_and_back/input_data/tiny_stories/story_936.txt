Once upon a time, there was a jolly cat named Tom. Tom liked to play with his friends in the park. They would run, jump, and dare each other to do fun things.
One day, Tom and his friends saw a big tree. They dared Tom to climb to the tip-top of the tree. Tom was scared but he wanted to be brave. So, he started to climb up, up, up the tree.
When Tom reached the tip-top, he saw a beautiful view. He felt so happy and proud. Tom's friends cheered for him from below. Then, Tom climbed down and they all played together. They had a very fun day in the park.
