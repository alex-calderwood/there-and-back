Jack was walking through the park on a very hot summer day. He was looking for a cool spot to rest when he saw a big sloppy dog with big floppy ears in a puddle. The dog was so filthy, with mud all over its body. Jack thought it looked funny, so he started laughing.
Suddenly, he heard a voice from behind. "Stop!" yelled the voice. Jack turned around, and saw a tall cop in a blue uniform. Jack was scared and started to cry.
The cop said, "What are you doing here, kid? You shouldn't be walking alone in the park!" Jack sniffled and said, "I'm sorry Officer. I didn't mean to do anything wrong."
The cop smiled and said, "It's alright buddy. Just be more careful next time, okay? Now, go on home, and stay out of trouble!" 
Jack wiped his tears away, and said, "Okay, Officer! Thank you!"
He ran home and told his mom everything that happened in the park. His mom said, "You see Jack! It's good to follow the rules and listen to the cops!" Jack nodded, and said, "Yes, Mom!"
