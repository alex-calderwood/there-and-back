Tom and Lily are playing in the park. They see a big fly with shiny wings. They want to catch it and look at it.
"Come here, fly!" Tom says. He runs after the fly with a net. Lily follows him.
The fly is fast and smart. It flies over the swings, the slide and the sandbox. Tom and Lily cannot catch it. They are tired and sad.
Then they see a big dog. The dog is barking and running. It wants to play with the fly too. But the dog is dangerous. It can bite and hurt the fly.
"Go away, dog!" Lily shouts. She waves her arms and tries to scare the dog. Tom does the same.
The dog stops and looks at them. It is confused. It does not understand why they are angry. It just wants to have fun.
The fly sees the chance. It flies away from the dog and lands on Lily's shoulder. It is safe and happy.
"Wow, you are brave, fly!" Tom says. He smiles and touches the fly gently. The fly tickles his finger.
"Thank you, Tom and Lily!" the fly says. It has a small voice. "You saved me from the dog. You are my friends."
Tom and Lily are surprised and happy. They can hear the fly talk. They have never heard a fly talk before.
"You are welcome, fly!" Lily says. She smiles and hugs the fly. "You are our friend too."
Tom and Lily are proud and happy. They have a new friend. They applaud and cheer for the fly. The fly flaps its wings and makes a sound. It is like music.
They play together in the park. They have a lot of fun. They forget about the dog. The dog finds a ball and plays with it. It forgets about the fly. Everyone is happy. The end.
