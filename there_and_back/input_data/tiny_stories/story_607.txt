Tom liked to write stories. He had a book with many pages and a pen with blue ink. He wrote about animals, cars, pirates and space. He wrote every day after school, in his room, on his desk.
One day, he wanted to write a new story, but it was dark outside. He turned on his lamp, but it did not work. He tried to change the bulb, but it was too hot. He asked his mom for help, but she was busy in the kitchen. He felt sad and angry. He could not write his story.
He looked around his room and saw his toys. He had a train, a robot, a ball and a teddy bear. He thought maybe he could play with them, but he did not feel like playing. He wanted to write his story.
Then he had an idea. He took his teddy bear and put it on his desk. He took his pen and wrote on the bear's tummy. He wrote "This is Bob. He is a bear. He likes honey and fish. He is my friend." He smiled and hugged his bear. He felt happy and proud. He had written his story.
He showed his mom his bear and his story. She smiled and said "That is very clever, Tom. You are a good writer. And your bear is very useful. He is a lamp and a book." She gave him a kiss and a cookie. He ate the cookie and thanked his mom. He put his bear on his bed and turned off the light. He fell asleep with his story in his mind.
