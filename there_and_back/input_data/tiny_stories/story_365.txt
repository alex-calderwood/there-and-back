Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had long, hairy hair that she loved a lot. One day, Lily went to the park to play and skip. She was very happy.
In the park, Lily saw a big, hairy dog with a ball. The dog looked friendly, so Lily went to play with it. They played catch and had lots of fun. But, Lily's hair got very messy while playing with the dog.
At the end of the day, Lily went home. Her mom saw her messy, hairy hair and knew what had happened. She smiled and said, "I knew you would have fun with the hairy dog at the park!" Lily laughed and told her mom all about her day. Then, they brushed Lily's hair together, making it neat and pretty again.
