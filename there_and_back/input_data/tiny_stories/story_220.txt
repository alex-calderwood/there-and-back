One day, a gray cat named Tom went to the store. He wanted to buy cocoa. Tom loved cocoa. He walked and walked until he saw the store.
At the store, Tom saw a big jar of cocoa. He tried to get it, but he was too small. Tom struggled to reach the cocoa. He jumped and jumped, but he could not get it.
A little girl saw Tom and said, "Do you need help, gray cat?" Tom nodded his head. The girl got the cocoa for Tom. But when she opened the jar, it was not cocoa! It was full of candy! Tom and the girl laughed and shared the candy. They became good friends.
