One day, a little boy was watching the sea. He saw a sailor walking towards him. The sailor looked a bit frightened. So, the little boy waved to the sailor and said a friendly hello. The sailor smiled and waved back.
The sailor told the little boy he was sailing across the sea. He said he had to get to a far away island. The little boy was so excited to hear about the sailor's journey.
The little boy asked the sailor if he could come along. But the sailor said it was too dangerous for him. He said it was much too far for him to travel. 
The little boy looked very sad. So the sailor said that, if the little boy wished, he could watch the sailor from shore. The little boy nodded and watched the sailor sail away. 
The little boy stayed and watched until the sailor was a tiny dot on the horizon. The little boy knew the sailor was safe now and smiled. He was excited for all the adventures the sailor was going to have.
