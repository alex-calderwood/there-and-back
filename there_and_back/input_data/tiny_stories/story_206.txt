Once, there was a cheerful bear. He was walking through the woods one sunny day when he heard a funny sound. He looked around and saw a rabbit squeezing a flower. The bear asked the rabbit why he was squeezing the flower and the rabbit said that he was squeezing a minute in which he could enjoy the sunshine. The bear thought this was a great idea and he decided to do the same.
So, the bear stretched out on the grass and carefully squeezed each minute for cheeky moments of fun. He rolled around in the flowers, sang sweet songs and even danced a jig. Every minute was full of beautiful cheerful moments.
When the sun started to set, the bear hugged the rabbit and said goodbye. He said his final goodbye to the forest before setting off on new adventures. He never forgot that wonderful day when he learnt how to squeeze each minute to make every day extraordinary.
