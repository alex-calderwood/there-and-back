Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play and have fun. But today is not a fun day. It is a grumpy day. Sara and Ben are grumpy because they have to stay inside. It is raining outside and they cannot go to the park.
They sit on the floor and look at their toys. They do not want to play with their toys. They are bored. They start to argue.
"I want the red car!" Sara says.
"No, it is mine!" Ben says.
They pull the car and make a loud noise. Mom hears the noise and comes to see.
"What is going on here?" Mom asks.
"Sara and Ben are grumpy," they say.
Mom smiles and says, "I have a surprise for you. Come with me."
Sara and Ben follow Mom to the living room. There, they see a big box with a bow. It is a gift.
"What is it?" Sara and Ben ask.
"It is a gift for you. You can open it together," Mom says.
Sara and Ben are curious. They forget their grumpiness. They tear the paper and open the box. Inside, they find a big tent and two sleeping bags.
"It is a camping set!" Mom says. "You can pretend to camp in the living room. You can make a fire, roast marshmallows, and tell stories."
Sara and Ben are happy. They hug Mom and say, "Thank you, Mom! You are the best!"
They set up the tent and the sleeping bags. They find some sticks and paper to make a fire. They find some marshmallows and a plate to roast them. They find some books and a flashlight to tell stories.
They have a lot of fun. They are not grumpy anymore. They are glad. They share the red car and the other toys. They say, "This is the best gift ever!"
