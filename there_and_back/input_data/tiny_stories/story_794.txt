One day, a girl named Mia saw a big, black cat in her garden. The cat had shiny eyes and soft fur. Mia liked cats, but this cat looked mysterious. She wondered where it came from and what it wanted.
She went outside and called to the cat. "Hello, kitty. Do you want to play with me?" The cat did not run away, but it did not come closer either. It just stared at Mia with its shiny eyes.
Mia took a step towards the cat. She wanted to touch its fur and hear it purr. But the cat hissed and showed its teeth. Mia stopped and felt scared. The cat did not trust her. It thought she was a danger.
Mia had an idea. She ran back inside and got a bowl of milk. She put the bowl on the ground and said to the cat, "Here, kitty. This is for you. I am not a danger. I am a friend."
The cat looked at the bowl and then at Mia. It smelled the milk and licked its lips. It walked slowly towards the bowl and drank the milk. Mia smiled and watched the cat. The cat finished the milk and looked at Mia again. It rubbed its head against Mia's leg and purred. Mia reached down and stroked its fur. The cat did not hiss or bite. It trusted her. It was a friend.
Mia and the cat played in the garden for a while. They chased each other and rolled on the grass. Mia laughed and the cat meowed. They had fun. Mia did not know where the cat came from or what it wanted. But she did not care. The cat was mysterious, but it was also nice. She liked the cat and the cat liked her. They were happy.
