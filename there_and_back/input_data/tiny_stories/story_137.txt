Hannah was a very happy little girl. She loved exploring her world and playing in her garden. One day she was walking in her garden when she saw a little white bunny hop across the land. 
"Oh!", she said. She wanted to follow it. She started to laugh and ran after it. 
The bunny hopped faster and faster. "Hurry, Hannah, hurry!" it said. 
Hannah could barely keep up with it. Finally, the rabbit stopped and went in a bush. She was so excited!
When she very cautiously peered in, she saw the bunny eating something sweet. She was so happy. 
The bunny saw Hannah peeking in and said, "Come on in, Hannah - I've saved some for you too!" 
Hannah happily joined the bunny in the bush, munching away on the sweet treat. She never forgot this moment in her garden.
