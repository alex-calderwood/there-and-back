Once upon a time there was a family who lived in a house with a broken fireplace. 
One day, the mother asked her little three-year-old daughter if she wanted to borrow some wood from their neighbours. 
The little girl was very excited and nodded her head up and down eagerly. 
So the mother and daughter put on their warmest coats and set off to the neighbours house. 
When they arrived, the little girl knocked on the door and the friendly neighbour asked her, "What can I do for you dear?"
The little girl answered, "We need to borrow some wood for the fireplace at our house." 
The friendly neighbour smiled and said, "Of course, come right in and take what you need." 
The little girl and her mother were very grateful and thanked the friendly neighbour before taking enough wood back to their house to get the broken fireplace up and running. 
The girl was so excited that from then on, she was always happy to help others and pay it forward!
