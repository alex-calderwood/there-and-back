One day, a boy named Tim was playing with his toy. It was a laser. Tim liked to march around the room with his laser. He would point it at things and make a "pew pew" sound. He thought it was fun.
Tim had a dog named Spot. Spot was a little bit stupid. When Tim marched with his laser, Spot would run and hide. He did not like the laser. Tim did not know why Spot was scared, but he kept playing.
One day, while Tim was marching with his laser, something unexpected happened. The laser made a real "pew pew" sound! Tim and Spot were surprised. The laser had turned into a real one! Tim decided to put the laser away and play with Spot instead. They had fun together, and Spot was not scared anymore.
