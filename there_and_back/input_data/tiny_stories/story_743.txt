Once, there was a daddy and he wanted to buy something. He asked a big question. He wanted to know what it was. The answer was very impressive.
The daddy went to the shop. He saw lots of cool things. He saw toy cars, cuddly animals, and play kitchens. He looked around for a while and then he decided to buy a new bike.
He was so excited. He wanted to ride the bike straight away. He asked the shopkeeper lots of questions. He wanted to make sure it was the best bike he could find. 
The shopkeeper was very impressive. He told the daddy all about the bike, the special tires and the bright colors. The daddy was so pleased that he bought the bike. 
That night, the daddy rode the bike with his little three-year-old child. They were so happy and the bike was so impressive! They had so much fun, and it was a night they would never forget.
