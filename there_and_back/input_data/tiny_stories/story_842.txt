Once upon a time, there was an old man. He lived in a small house. The old man liked to walk. Every day, he took big steps and little steps.
One day, the old man saw a big box. The box was on his step. He did not know where it came from. The old man was very surprised. He opened the box.
Inside the box was a cat. The cat was not old. It was a baby cat. The baby cat was very cute. The old man and the baby cat became best friends. They walked together every day. And they lived happily ever after.
