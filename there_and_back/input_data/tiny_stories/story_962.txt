Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She was 3 years old and liked to play all day long. But everyday, she would get very tired, so at night she had to sleep. Mia was a very healthy girl and always ate a big salad for lunch. Her mom made the salad very thick, with lots of yummy vegetables. 
Then one day, Mia said she didn’t want to eat her salad. She said it was too thick and she didn’t like it. But her mom said that she had to eat it, if she wanted to have energy to play. So Mia listened and ate the whole salad.
After that, Mia felt very happy. She had lots of fun with her little toy friends. But as the day went on, she started to feel very sleepy. So Mia went to bed, put on her cozy pajamas and quickly fell asleep. 
When morning came, Mia woke up feeling very refreshed and ready to go out and play again. All because she had eaten her thick salad the day before!
