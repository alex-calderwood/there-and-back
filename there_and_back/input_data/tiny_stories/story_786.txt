One day, a little girl named Lily saw a pretty vase in her mommy's room. The vase was big and had adorable flowers on it. Lily wanted to see the vase up close, but it was too high for her to reach.
Lily had an idea. She went to the kitchen and found a chair. She pushed the chair to her mommy's room and said, "Now I can rise up and see the vase better!" She climbed on the chair and looked at the vase. It was even more pretty up close.
Just then, her mommy came in and saw Lily on the chair. She said, "Lily, you should ask for help when you want to see something high up. It's not safe to climb on chairs by yourself." Lily understood and said sorry to her mommy. From that day on, Lily always asked for help when she wanted to see something high up. She learned that it's better to ask for help than to do something unsafe.
