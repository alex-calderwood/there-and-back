Once upon a time, there was a queen who loved to keep her castle clean. She did not like anything dirty or filthy. One day, she saw a little mouse in her castle. The queen was not happy.
"Little mouse, why are you in my clean castle?" the queen asked. The mouse looked at the queen and said, "I am sorry, queen. I will not make your castle filthy. I can help you keep it clean."
The queen thought about it and said, "Okay, little mouse. You can stay and help me keep my castle clean." They worked together every day to keep the castle clean and shiny.
One day, the queen dropped her shiny ring down the sink. She was very sad. The little mouse said, "Don't worry, queen. I can help you." The mouse went into the sink and got the ring back for the queen. The queen was very happy and thanked the little mouse. From that day on, they were the best of friends.
The moral of the story is that even the smallest friends can be very helpful, and we should not judge them by their size or how they look.
