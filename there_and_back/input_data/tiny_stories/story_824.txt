Once upon a time, there was a graceful cat named Lily. Lily was very good at jumping and playing. She loved to catch toys in the air.
One day, Lily found a new toy. It was a switch. She did not know what it did, but she liked to play with it. She would hit it with her paw and watch it move. It was so much fun!
One day, while playing with the switch, Lily hit it just right and something magical happened. All of her toys started to dance and move on their own! Lily was so happy. She spent the whole day catching her dancing toys and playing with the switch. And from that day on, Lily and the switch were the best of friends.
