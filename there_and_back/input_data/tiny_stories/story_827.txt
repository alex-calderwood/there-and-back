Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Tom. Tom liked to organize his toys in his room. He had a lot of power to move his toys around.
One day, Tom's friend, a little bird named Tim, came to visit. Tim saw Tom organizing his toys and wanted to help. "Can I help you?" asked Tim. Tom said, "Yes, you can help me. Thank you."
Together, Tom and Tim organized all the toys. They had fun and Tom was not grumpy anymore. They played with the toys and were very happy.
