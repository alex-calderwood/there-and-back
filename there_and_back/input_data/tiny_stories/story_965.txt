Once upon a time, there was a kind bug. The bug liked to teach. It taught other bugs to be nice. All the bugs lived in a big tree.
One day, a new bug came to the tree. The new bug did not know how to be kind. The kind bug wanted to teach the new bug. But the new bug did not want to learn. The new bug was not nice to the other bugs.
Then, something unexpected happened. The new bug fell into a hole. The kind bug helped the new bug out of the hole. The new bug was happy. The new bug wanted to learn how to be kind now. They all lived happily in the big tree.
