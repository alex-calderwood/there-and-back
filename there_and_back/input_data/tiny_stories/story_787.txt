Once upon a time, there was a dependable rabbit named Toot. He was living in a beautiful forest, with lots of other animals.
One day a mean fox came to the forest, looking for something to eat. He noticed Toot right away and started chasing him.
Toot tried to run away but he couldn't keep up with the fox. He ran and ran until he was so tired he had to stop.
The fox came up to Toot and said, "Surrender now or I will bite you!"
Toot was afraid and didn't know what to do. Then, he remembered his dependable tooth. He smiled and said, "I won't surrender to you, but I can use my dependable tooth to get away from you!"
The fox was so surprised, he backed away and ran away. Toot was saved! He had used his dependable tooth to protect himself.
After that day, Toot was always grateful for his dependable tooth, and thanked it every time he saw it.
