One day, a big lion was walking in the forest. He saw a little bird on the ground. The bird looked worried. The lion asked, "Why are you worried, little bird?"
The bird said, "I can't fly. My wing hurts. I need to go to my nest, but I can't."
The lion wanted to help the bird. But the bird was scared of the lion's big roar. The lion tried to be quiet, but he roared loudly by mistake. The bird was even more worried now.
The lion felt bad. He said, "I'm sorry, little bird. I will help you." The lion picked up the bird gently with his mouth. He walked to the tree with the bird's nest. The lion put the bird in the nest. The bird was happy and said, "Thank you, big lion."
The lion and the bird became friends. The lion promised not to roar near the bird again. They played together in the forest every day.
