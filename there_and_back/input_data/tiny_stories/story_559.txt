One day, a little boy named Tim was playing with his toy cars. He loved to count them as they raced around the room. Tim's mom called out, "Tim, time to go to the bathroom before bed!" Tim felt weak because he was very tired from playing.
As Tim walked to the bathroom, he saw a big shadow on the wall. He was scared, but he knew he had to be brave. So, he went into the bathroom and counted to three, hoping the shadow would go away.
Tim heard a voice say, "Why are you counting?" He looked around and saw a friendly monster in the bathroom! The monster was sad because he was lost and needed help to find his way home. Tim wanted to help, but he was too weak and tired.
"I can't help you, Mr. Monster. I'm too weak," Tim said. The monster started to cry, and Tim felt bad. He tried to think of a way to help, but he was just too tired.
The next morning, Tim woke up and remembered the monster. He ran to the bathroom, but the monster was gone. Tim felt sad that he couldn't help the monster find his way home. He wished he had been stronger and not so weak.
