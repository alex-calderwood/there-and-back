One day, a cat and a dog were at the park. They saw a great bench. The cat said, "Let's sit on the bench and order ice cream." The dog agreed.
They sat on the bench and a man came to take their order. The cat ordered a fish ice cream and the dog ordered a bone ice cream. They were very excited.
But then, something unexpected happened! A bird flew by and took both of their ice creams. The cat and the dog were sad. The bird said, "I'm sorry, I was just very hungry." The cat and the dog forgave the bird and they all became friends.
