Once upon a time, in a small town, there was an old structure. It was a big house where many animals lived. One day, a little mouse named Tim found a big, red ball in the house. He was very happy and wanted to play with it.
Tim wanted to grab the ball, but it was too big for him. He asked his friend, a kind rabbit named Sam, to help him. Sam was strong and could grab the ball easily. Together, they played with the ball all day, rolling it around and having lots of fun.
At the end of the day, Tim and Sam were tired but happy. They learned that when they help each other, they can do anything. The moral of the story is that working together and helping your friends makes everything more fun and easy.
