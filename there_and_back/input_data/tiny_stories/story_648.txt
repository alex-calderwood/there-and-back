One day, a wild bird set out to find a key. The bird flew high in the sky and saw many things. It saw a big tree, a red ball, and a small dog. The bird looked and looked for the key, but could not find it.
The wild bird asked a cat, "Have you seen a key?" The cat said, "No, I have not seen a key. But you can look in the big tree." So, the bird went to the big tree and looked for the key. It saw a squirrel, but no key.
Finally, the wild bird asked a frog, "Have you seen a key?" The frog said, "Yes, I saw a key by the pond." The bird went to the pond and found the key. The wild bird was happy to find the key and flew back home.
