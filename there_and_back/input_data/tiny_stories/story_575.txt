Once upon a time, there was a lady who had a very special job. Her job was to find hidden things. Every day, the lady put on her special hat and went looking for things that were hidden. She followed the clues she found and searched all around until she found the hidden things. 
One day, the lady found something special hidden in the forest. It was an amazing secret that nobody knew about. She was so excited when she found it! 
But then, the lady heard something that made her stop. She heard another voice in the forest and decided to follow it. When she went to follow the voice, she found a group of kids playing in the trees. 
The lady was so happy to have found the hidden kids in the forest. She knew it was time for her to do her job. She listened to the kids and chatted with them. She even gave them some yummy snacks from her special bag!
The lady found so many hidden things that day and she finally finished her job. She went home happy that she had helped find the kids in the forest. Her job was done and all the hidden things were revealed!
