Once, there was a little girl named Kate. She was out playing in her backyard when she saw a bunny. The bunny was stuck and couldn't move. 
Kate went over to the bunny and said, "I will rescue you!" With that, she carefully picked up the bunny and put it in a safe spot.
The bunny was so happy that Kate had rescued it and gave her a present. It was a small box with a spoon and some yogurt inside. 
Kate was so excited and tasted the yogurt. It was so good! She thanked the bunny for the yogurt and said goodbye. 
Kate and the bunny lived happily ever after.
