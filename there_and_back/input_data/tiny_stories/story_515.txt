Once upon a time, there was a little duck who wanted to store all the food he had. He decided to go to the port to try and find a place to store some food. But when he went to the port, he saw that it was very troubled. People were running, screaming, and panicking. There was a big storm on the way, and they were all trying to get out of the port before it became very dangerous.
The little duck was very scared, and didn't know what to do. He just wanted to store his food and get away from the storm. But he knew he had to be careful. He asked some of the people on the street what he should do, and he soon found a nice, quiet spot where he could store his food.
He was relieved to find the perfect spot, but he was still worried about the storm. He hoped it would just pass by quickly. He wrapped up his food and put it in a safe place, and then he waited.
Eventually, the storm passed, and the little duck was relieved. He had managed to store his food safely and was able to go home without being troubled anymore.
The end.
