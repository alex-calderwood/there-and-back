Once upon a time, there was a strong dog named Max. Max liked to play with his ball all day. He had a big yard where he could run and jump.
One day, Max found a big box in the yard. The box was open. Max wanted to know what was inside. He put his ball on the box to weigh it down. Then, he looked inside the box.
Max was surprised. Inside the box, there was a little cat. The cat looked scared. Max wanted to help the cat. He took his ball off the box and the cat came out. Max and the cat became friends and played together all day.
