Once there was a small cat. It was very smooth. Each day it would stretch its body and enjoy the sunny day. 
One day, the cat went to stretch outside. It was about to reach for the sun when suddenly a big dog appeared. It barked at the cat and the cat was scared. The cat tried to run away, but the dog chased it. 
The cat ran faster and faster, but the dog was too strong. The dog caught the cat and bit it. The cat was so scared it started to cry. The dog ran away and the cat was left with a bloody scratch. The cat had a bad ending to its day.
