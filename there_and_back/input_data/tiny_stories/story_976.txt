One day, Cat and Dog had a plan. They wanted to find yummy food in the big freezer. They opened the freezer and saw many things. They saw cold ice, tasty fish, and smelly cheese. Cat said, "I like fish!" Dog said, "I like smelly cheese!"
They took the fish and cheese out of the freezer. They were very happy. But then, something unexpected happened. The ice in the freezer started to melt. The floor became wet and slippery. Cat and Dog were surprised.
Cat and Dog had to think fast. They put the fish and cheese back in the freezer. They closed the door and cleaned the wet floor. They learned that they should ask for help next time. They were still friends and they laughed about their big adventure.
