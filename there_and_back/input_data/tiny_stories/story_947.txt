One day, a big spider went to a store. The spider wanted to order a big cake. The store man was scared. He did not like spiders. He said, "No, I will not give you a cake."
The spider was sad. But then, something strange happened. The spider became enormous! It was bigger than the store. The store man was very scared now. He said, "Please, take the cake and go away."
The enormous spider took the cake and went home. It shared the cake with all its spider friends. They were all very happy. And from that day, the store man was not scared of spiders anymore.
