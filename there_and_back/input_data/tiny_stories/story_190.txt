Once upon a time, there was a pig. He was blue and thought he was special. He was strolling in the field when he encountered a big, mean bull. The pig thought the bull was teasing him. He became scared. 
"Why were you teasing me?" asked the pig.
"Ha! You are too small and blue to do anything about it," said the bull.
The pig became very angry and challenged the bull to a fight. The bull accepted and the fight started. The pig charged the bull, but he couldn't win. That was the end of the pig.
The moral of the story? Bullies always win and it doesn't pay to tease others.
