Once upon a time there was a kind lady who lived in a house with a fence around it. Every day she would go out to the fence and take care of it. She watered the flowers, trimmed the grass and kept the fence in good condition.
One day when she went back to the fence something strange had happened. The fence had become a ladder. She was very surprised but also happy. She thought of all the possibilities this new ladder could bring her and was excited for the new adventures to come. 
The kind lady climbed up the ladder and as she looked around she saw many new and exciting things. She decided to explore the new world and see all of the amazing things it had to offer. She climbed and jumped, walked and flew. 
As the sun started to set, the kind lady suddenly remembered her fence. She quickly climbed down the ladder and as soon as she touched the ground the ladder had become a fence again. The kind lady was very happy with her adventure and was thankful that she had such a kind fence to help her explore her new world.
