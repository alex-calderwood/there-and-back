One day, a little boy named Tim found a warm, red triangle on the floor. He picked it up and smiled. He liked the triangle very much, and he wanted to keep it. But, his friend Lily saw the triangle and wanted it too.
Tim and Lily did not know what to do. They both wanted the warm, red triangle. They started to feel sad. They did not want to fight, but they both wanted the triangle so much.
Then, Tim had an idea. He said, "Let's share the triangle!" Lily smiled and agreed. They played with the warm, red triangle together, and they were both very happy. They learned that sharing was better than fighting.
