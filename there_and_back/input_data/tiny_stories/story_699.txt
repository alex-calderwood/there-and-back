Once upon a time, in a cheerful house, there lived a little girl named Lily. She loved to run and play all day long. Her house had lots of colorful furniture that she liked to hide behind.
One sunny day, Lily was playing with her best friend, a talking cat named Whiskers. They were running around the house, laughing and having fun. Whiskers said, "Let's play hide and seek, Lily!" Lily was very excited and agreed to play.
Lily started to count, "One, two, three..." while Whiskers ran to hide. She looked behind the big chair, under the table, and even in the toy box. Finally, she found Whiskers hiding behind the yellow couch. They both laughed and played hide and seek all day long, feeling very happy in their cheerful house.
