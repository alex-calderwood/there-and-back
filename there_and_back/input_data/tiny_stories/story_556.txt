One day, a cat saw a dull toy. The cat wanted to play, so it went to find a friend. The cat saw a dog and said, "Will you play with me?"
The dog said, "Yes, let's play!" The cat gave the dull toy to the dog. They played and played. They were very happy.
Suddenly, the dull toy began to shine! It turned into a beautiful, bright toy. The cat and the dog were very surprised. They played with the bright toy all day long and became best friends.
