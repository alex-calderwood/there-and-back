One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park with his mom. He saw a big tree and wanted to climb it. Tim's mom said, "Be careful, Tim!" Tim started to climb the tree. He looked up and saw a bird's nest. He was very proud of himself for climbing so high.
Suddenly, Tim heard a loud noise. He looked down and saw a dog barking at him. The dog wanted to play with Tim, but Tim was scared. He called out, "Mom, help! The dog is barking at me!" His mom came running and said, "Don't worry, Tim. The dog just wants to play."
Then, Tim had an idea. He climbed down the tree and picked up a stick. He threw the stick, and the dog ran after it. When the dog brought the stick back, Tim and the dog became friends. They played together all day long. At the end of the day, Tim had a big surprise. The dog's owner came to the park and said, "Thank you for playing with my dog. You can keep him!" Tim was so happy and proud. He loved his new dog, and they went home together.
