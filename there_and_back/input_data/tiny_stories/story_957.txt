Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys and watch videos. One day, they go to Ben's house. Ben has many videos. He has videos of cars, animals, songs and stories.
"Let's sort the videos," Ben says. "We can put the ones we like in one pile and the ones we don't like in another pile."
"OK," Anna says. "I like the videos of animals. They are cute."
They start to sort the videos. Anna picks up a video of a lion. She puts it in the pile she likes. Ben picks up a video of a car. He puts it in the pile he likes.
They keep sorting the videos. But soon they have a problem. Anna likes a video of a bunny. She thinks it is cute. But Ben does not like it. He thinks it is boring.
"No, Anna," Ben says. "That video is not good. It is for babies. Put it in the other pile."
"But I like it," Anna says. "It is cute. I want to watch it."
They start to argue. They pull the video from each other. They shout and cry. They are not friends anymore.
The video breaks. It falls on the floor. It makes a loud noise. Ben's mom comes in. She sees the mess. She sees the broken video. She sees Anna and Ben.
She is angry. She tells Anna to go home. She tells Ben to go to his room. She takes away all the videos. She says they cannot watch them for a week.
Anna and Ben are sad. They are sorry. They wish they did not fight. They wish they could watch the videos. They wish they could be friends again. But it is too late. The end.
