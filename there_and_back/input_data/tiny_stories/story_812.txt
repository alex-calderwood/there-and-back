Once upon a time, there was a big, angry bear. The bear lived in a forest. He was angry because he was always hungry. He wanted to find food, but he was too big and slow.
One day, the bear saw a little, fast rabbit. The rabbit had a lot of food. The bear wanted to borrow some food from the rabbit. But the rabbit was afraid of the big, angry bear.
The bear decided to be nice to the rabbit. He asked the rabbit, "Can I borrow some food? I will give you something too." The rabbit thought about it and said, "Okay, you can borrow some food. But you must give me weight to make me strong." The bear agreed.
The bear and the rabbit became friends. They shared food and weight. The bear was not angry anymore. They lived happily in the forest together.
