One day, a curious little dog named Max went for a walk in a big field. Max loved to run and play in the field. He saw a big tree and lots of flowers. Max was very happy.
Max saw a little girl named Lily near a pond. Lily was playing with a toy boat. "Hi, Max!" said Lily. "Do you want to play with me?" Max wagged his tail and barked, "Yes!"
Lily and Max played near the pond. They laughed and had fun. Then, Max got dirty from playing. Lily said, "Max, you need to bathe!" So, they went to the pond, and Lily helped Max bathe in the water. Max was clean and happy again. They went back to the field and played until the sun went down.
