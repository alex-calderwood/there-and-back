Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Bobo. Bobo had a big head and loved to play with his ball. One day, he saw a big hill and wanted to gain the top of the hill to see what was there.
Bobo ran up the hill, but it was not easy. He tried and tried, but he could not gain the top. He was sad, but he did not give up. He thought of his ball and how it would bounce up and down. Bobo had an idea.
Bobo went back down the hill and got his ball. He pushed the ball up the hill, and it helped him gain the top. When he reached the top, he saw a big tree with lots of yummy treats. Bobo was so happy that he had not given up. He learned that with a little help, he could do big things.
