Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a big bag of rice. He wanted to know how heavy the bag was. So, he went to his mom and asked her to help him weigh the bag. His mom put the bag on a big scale. The scale showed that the bag was very heavy.
One day, Tim saw an open box in his room. He thought it would be fun to pour the rice into the box. So, he opened the bag and poured all the rice into the open box. The rice filled the box up to the top. Tim was very happy to see the rice in the box.
Tim's mom came into the room and saw the rice in the open box. She smiled and said, "Now we can cook the rice for dinner!" Tim and his mom cooked the rice together. They had a yummy dinner with the rice. Tim was very proud that he could help his mom with the rice. And they all lived happily ever after.
