One day, a curious little bird named Tim wanted to soar high in the sky. He saw a big fountain in the park. Tim wanted to play in the water. He flew down to the fountain and splashed around.
A little girl named Sue saw Tim and said, "Hi, bird! Do you like the water?" Tim nodded his head and chirped happily. Sue laughed and clapped her hands.
Tim and Sue played by the fountain all day. They were very happy. Tim learned that it was fun to soar high in the sky, but it was even better to have a friend to play with.
