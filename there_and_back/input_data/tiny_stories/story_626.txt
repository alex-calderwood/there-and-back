Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim liked to play with his toy cars. One day, his mom told him to behave and stay inside the house because it was very hot outside. She also said to use lotion to keep his skin safe. But Tim felt dizzy inside and wanted to go out and play.
Tim thought of a plan. He put on the lotion and went outside to play with his cars. He was having so much fun that he forgot about his mom's warning. As he played, the sun got hotter and hotter.
Suddenly, something unexpected happened. The sun was so hot that it started to melt Tim's toy cars! Tim was sad and realized he should have listened to his mom. He went back inside the house with his melted cars, wishing he had behaved and stayed inside.
