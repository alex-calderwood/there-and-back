Lily and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to make noises with their cars and dolls. But their mom was working in the kitchen and she needed quiet.
"Please, children, can you play with your voice off?" she asked. "I have to make a phone call and it is very important."
Lily and Ben nodded, but they did not want to stop playing. They whispered to each other and thought of a clever plan. They decided to remove their voice and hide it under the sofa. Then they could play as loud as they wanted and their mom would not hear them.
They took turns to hold their nose and mouth and make a big cough. They pretended that their voice came out and they caught it in their hands. They ran to the sofa and put their voice under it. Then they smiled and went back to their toys.
They made a lot of noise with their cars and dolls. They laughed and shouted and sang. They had so much fun. But their mom did not hear them. She finished her phone call and came to the living room.
She saw Lily and Ben playing happily. She was surprised and pleased. She thought they were very good and quiet. She did not know that they had removed their voice and hidden it under the sofa.
She hugged them and said, "Thank you, children, for being so nice and quiet. You are very clever. Do you want a snack?"
Lily and Ben nodded, but they could not say anything. They had no voice. They looked at each other and realized their mistake. They ran to the sofa and tried to find their voice. But it was gone. They had lost their voice.
They started to cry and panic. They did not know what to do. They wished they had not removed their voice and hidden it under the sofa. They wished they had listened to their mom and played with their voice off. They learned a hard lesson.
