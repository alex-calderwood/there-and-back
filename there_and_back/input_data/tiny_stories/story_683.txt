Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Amy. She had a wide smile and loved to play with her friends. One day, Amy found a mask. It was a funny mask with a big nose and silly eyes.
Amy wore the mask and went to play with her friends. They all laughed and had fun with the mask. But soon, Amy's friends started to urge her to take off the mask. They wanted to see her wide smile again. Amy did not want to take off the mask. She thought her friends liked her more with the mask on.
Amy's mom saw her with the mask and asked her to take it off. She said, "Amy, your wide smile is what makes you special. You don't need a mask to make your friends like you." Amy took off the mask and her friends clapped. They were happy to see her wide smile again.
The moral of the story is to always be yourself and not hide behind a mask. Your true friends will love you just the way you are.
