Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tom. Tom liked to pick fruit from the trees in his yard. One sunny day, he went outside to pick some fruit for his snack. He saw a big, red apple on a high branch. He wanted that apple very much.
As Tom tried to reach the apple, he heard a small voice. "Please don't pick me," said the apple. Tom was very surprised. He had never heard an apple talk before. He looked around, and then he saw a tiny ant. The ant was alert and looked at Tom.
"Hello, Tom," said the ant. "I live in this apple. If you pick it, my home will be gone." Tom did not want to take the ant's home away. So, he picked another fruit from a different tree. The ant was happy, and Tom had a tasty snack. They became good friends and played together in the yard every day.
