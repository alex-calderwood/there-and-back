Sara likes to sign. She signs with her hands and her face. She signs hello, thank you, and I love you. She signs to her mom, her dad, and her cat. She signs when she is happy, sad, or angry.
One day, Sara sees a dress in the store. The dress is red and shiny. It has flowers and ribbons. Sara wants the dress. She signs to her mom, please, please, please. But her mom says no. The dress is too big, too expensive, and too fancy. Sara is sad. She signs, I want the dress.
Sara has an idea. She waits until her mom is busy. She runs to the dress. She takes it off the rack. She puts it on. She looks at herself in the mirror. She feels mighty. She signs, I have the dress.
But then, a man comes. The man works in the store. He sees Sara with the dress. He is angry. He says, you cannot take the dress. You have to pay for it. He takes the dress from Sara. He pulls it hard. The dress rips. The flowers and ribbons fall off. The dress is ruined.
Sara is scared. She signs, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. But the man does not understand. He does not know sign. He calls Sara's mom. He tells her what Sara did. Sara's mom is very mad. She says, Sara, you are in big trouble. You have to say sorry to the man. You have to pay for the dress. You have to go home. No more signing for you today.
Sara cries. She signs, I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. But no one listens. She has no dress. She has no fun. She has no sign. She feels very small. She wishes she never saw the dress.
