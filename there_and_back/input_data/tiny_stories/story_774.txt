One day a little boy was playing in the garden. He found a model boat and held it in his hands. He ran to show his mother and she smiled. She held the model boat in her hands, and said "Now let's put this in the pond, and it will float". So the little boy and his mommy walked to the pond. The surface of the pond glittered like diamonds. The little boy took the model boat and carefully put it in the pond. The boat floated like a dream. But the little boy wanted more. He wanted the boat to move, so he got a stick and tried to push it. He pushed it harder and suddenly, the boat went faster and faster, zooming around the pond. As it went, the shining water from the pond began to soak the little boy's feet. His mommy smiled and said "Let's take off your shoes and socks, they are getting soaked!". So, the little boy happily kicked off his shoes and socks and felt the soft grass between his toes. His Mama said "Let's play catch with the model boat". The little boy laughed and jumped into the pond, chasing after his boat. His mommy smiled and said "We can take it home now, it looks like you had a lot of fun". They picked up the model boat and walked home, with the little boy still wet and happy.
