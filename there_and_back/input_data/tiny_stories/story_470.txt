Once upon a time, there was a big, ugly fish who lived in the sea. The ugly fish loved to surf on the waves. One day, while surfing, he met a nice, pretty fish.
"Hi," said the pretty fish. "Do you want to play with me?"
The ugly fish felt embarrass. He thought the pretty fish would not want to play with him because he was ugly. But he said, "Yes, I want to play."
The pretty fish and the ugly fish played together all day. They surfed on the waves and had lots of fun. In the end, they became the best of friends. The ugly fish learned that it does not matter how you look, but how you are inside.
