Once, there was a girl named Amy. She loved to read books. One day, she found a big book called a novel. It had many stories inside. Amy was very happy and wanted to read it all day.
Amy's mom said, "Amy, be careful with the big book." But Amy was careless. She carried the novel everywhere she went. One day, she dropped it in a puddle. The pages got wet and dirty. Amy was sad.
Amy's friend, Tom, saw her crying. He came close and whispered, "Amy, don't cry. We can clean the book." They worked together to clean the novel. Soon, it looked good again. Amy said, "Thank you, Tom!" They sat down and read the stories together, happy and careful with the big book.
