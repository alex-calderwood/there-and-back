One day, a long cat named Tom went for a walk. He saw a big triangle on the ground. He was very hungry, so he decided to eat the triangle. Tom took a big bite and started to chew.
As Tom was eating the triangle, something strange happened. The triangle began to glow! It was very bright and pretty. Tom stopped eating and watched the glowing triangle.
Suddenly, the triangle turned into a magic bird! The bird said, "Thank you for not eating me, Tom. I will give you a wish!" Tom thought for a moment and wished for lots of food. The bird waved its wings, and lots of yummy food appeared. Tom was very happy and thanked the magic bird. They both ate the food and became good friends.
