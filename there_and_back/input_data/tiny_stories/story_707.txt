One day, a little girl named Mia went for a wander in the park. She saw a vendor with many toys. Mia wanted to buy a toy, but she had no money. She felt sad and walked away.
Mia found a spoiled apple on the ground. She picked it up and took it back to the vendor. She asked if she could trade the apple for a toy. The vendor looked at the apple and thought for a moment.
To Mia's surprise, the vendor said yes! He gave Mia a toy and took the spoiled apple. Mia was very happy. She learned that sometimes, unexpected things can happen when you ask nicely.
