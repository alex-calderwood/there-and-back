Once upon a time, in a jolly little town, there lived a big cat named Tom. Tom loved to play and run all day. He had many friends who liked to play with him, too.
One day, Tom felt very tired. He let out a big yawn while playing with his friends. His friends saw this and knew that Tom needed to rest soon. They thought of a plan to help him.
The next day, Tom's friends took him to a nice, soft bed. They told him it was a surprise. Tom lay down on the bed and felt so happy. He knew his friends loved him. Tom yawned again, closed his eyes, and had a good sleep.
