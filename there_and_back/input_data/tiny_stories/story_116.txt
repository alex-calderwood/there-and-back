Once upon a time, there was a unique town with many people. In this town, there was a lawyer named Bob. Bob was a good man who helped others.
One day, a little boy named Timmy broke a window while playing ball. Timmy was scared and didn't want to be punished. He went to Bob the lawyer for help. Bob said, "Don't worry, Timmy. I will talk to the people and fix this."
Bob talked to the people in the town. He told them Timmy was sorry and would be more careful. The people agreed not to punish Timmy. They were happy Bob helped them.
Timmy was very thankful to Bob. He learned to be more careful and not break things. Everyone in the town was happy and they all lived in peace.
