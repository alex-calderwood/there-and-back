Once upon a time, there was a unique little muffin. It was special because it could blink its eyes. The muffin lived in a small house with its friends, a cat and a dog.
One day, the cat and the dog went outside to play. The muffin blinked its eyes and wished it could go too. It tried to move, but it was too hard. The muffin felt sad.
Then, a kind bird saw the muffin and wanted to help. The bird picked up the muffin with its beak and flew outside. The muffin blinked its eyes in joy. Now, the muffin, the cat, and the dog could all play together. They had lots of fun, and the muffin was very happy.
