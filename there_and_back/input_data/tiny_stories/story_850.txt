One day, a lazy cat named Tom was laying on the green lawn. He liked to sleep in the sun all day. His friend, a dog named Max, came to play with him.
Max said, "Tom, I warn you, it is not good to be lazy all the time. We should play and have fun!"
Tom did not listen to Max. He just wanted to sleep on the lawn all day.
One day, a big rain came. Tom was still on the lawn. Max tried to warn Tom again, "Tom, the rain is coming! We need to go inside!"
But Tom did not listen. He was too lazy to move. The rain came and Tom got all wet and cold. He was sad and wished he had listened to Max.
The moral of the story is: listen to your friends when they warn you, and don't be too lazy.
