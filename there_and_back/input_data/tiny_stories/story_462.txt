Once upon a time there was a little bird. He wanted to escape. He flew and flew, but he felt dizzy. He saw a tall tree and thought he could use it to get away. He perched on a branch and looked around.
Suddenly, he heard a voice. It was a fox. "Where do you think you are going, little bird?", the fox said. The bird was so scared he could not answer. He wanted to fly away, but he was too dizzy. 
The fox said, "I can lead you to safety. Come with me." The bird followed the fox, hoping he was telling the truth. The fox led the bird through the trees, but it started to get darker and darker. 
The fox said, “We have arrived. Here is your escape.” But the bird realized too late that the fox had been lying. He had led the little bird right into a hunter’s trap! 
The little bird twittered sadly as the hunter slapped the net shut. He had been tricked and now he couldn’t escape. The End.
