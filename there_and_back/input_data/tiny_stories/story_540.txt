Once upon a time, there was a brave little cat named Tom. Tom liked to play outside and chase birds. One day, Tom saw a big cobweb in the corner of the yard.
Tom wanted to touch the cobweb, but he was scared. He took a deep breath and said, "I am brave. I can do it." With a big jump, Tom touched the cobweb. It felt soft and a little sticky.
After playing with the cobweb, Tom felt tired. He went under a tree and lay down on the soft grass. Tom closed his eyes and took a rest. He felt happy and brave.
