Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a kind girl named Amy. She had a big toy tank that she loved to play with every day. Amy would take her tank outside and test how fast it could go.
One day, Amy met a boy named Tim who was sad. He did not have any toys to play with. Amy thought for a moment and decided to share her tank with Tim. They both took turns testing the tank and had a lot of fun.
After playing together, Tim was very happy. He thanked Amy for being so kind and sharing her tank with him. From that day on, they became best friends and always played with the tank together.
