Once upon a time, in a small, calm town, there lived a little bird named Billy. Billy loved to whistle all day long. He would whistle to the sun, the trees, and the flowers. Everyone in the town could hear Billy's happy whistling.
One day, while Billy was whistling, he met a big, friendly dog named Max. Max looked at Billy and said, "Your whistling is very nice. Can you teach me how to whistle too?" Billy thought for a moment and said, "Yes, I can help you."
So, Billy and Max spent the day together, trying to teach Max how to whistle. They practiced by the river, under the trees, and in the town. By the end of the day, Max could whistle a little bit, just like Billy. They were both very happy and proud.
From that day on, Billy and Max became the best of friends. They would whistle together every day, making the calm town even happier. And everyone in the town would smile when they heard Billy and Max whistling together.
