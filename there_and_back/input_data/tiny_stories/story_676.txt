Once upon a time, there was a large bird named Biggie. Biggie was very nice, but he could not fly. He would watch his friends fly and play in the sky. Biggie felt sad that he could not join them.
One day, Biggie saw a little bug named Tiny. Tiny was trying to carry a large leaf, but it was too heavy for him. Biggie wanted to help. He said, "Tiny, let me help you!" Biggie managed to lift the large leaf with his beak. Tiny was very happy.
Then, something unexpected happened. As Biggie lifted the leaf, he felt a strong wind. The wind lifted Biggie, Tiny, and the leaf up into the sky! Biggie was flying for the first time! He was so happy.
Biggie and Tiny became best friends. They learned that when they help each other, they can do anything. The moral of the story is that a good friend can help you see new sights and do things you never thought you could do.
