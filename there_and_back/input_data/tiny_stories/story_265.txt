Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She loved to organize her toys. One day, she decided to make a big show with her dolls and stuffed animals. She invited her friends to watch the show.
Mia wanted her friends to sit on seats that she made from her toy blocks. She put the seats in a row so everyone could see the show. She was so excited that she felt a little dizzy.
The show was fun and all her friends clapped and laughed. Mia was happy that she organized the seats and the show. After the show, they all played together and had a great day.
