Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a boy named Tim. He liked to eat rice every day. He liked his rice the original way, with no extra things in it.
One day, Tim went to the kitchen to cut some vegetables for his rice. He was very careful with the knife. But then, he saw a big bug on the table. He tried to hit the bug with the knife, but he missed and cut his finger. It hurt a lot, and he cried.
Tim's mom came into the kitchen and saw what happened. She put a bandage on his finger and told him not to play with the knife again. But Tim's finger still hurt, and he could not eat his original rice that day. He was sad and went to bed hungry.
