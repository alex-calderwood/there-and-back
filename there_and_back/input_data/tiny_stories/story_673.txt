Once upon a time, there was a wealthy man who lived in a big, pretty house. He had many cards with colors and pictures on them. One day, he wanted to carry his cards to his friend's house to show them off.
The wealthy man put the cards in a small bag and began to carry it. As he walked, he saw a little dog. The little dog was lost and sad. The wealthy man thought, "I should help this little dog find its home."
He picked up the little dog and carried it, along with his cards, to his friend's house. When they got there, the little dog wagged its tail and barked happily. The wealthy man's friend knew whose dog it was and helped it get back home.
The wealthy man and his friend looked at the cards together. They were happy because they had helped the little dog. And from that day on, the wealthy man always made sure to help others when he could.
