Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to race with his friends. They would race all the way from the big tree to the little pond. Tim always won the race, and his friends were grateful because he was a good friend.
One day, Tim's mom was baking a cake in the oven. She told Tim to wait for the cake to be ready. But Tim was too excited and wanted to race. He told his friends to get ready for a big race while the cake was baking.
As the race started, Tim was in the lead. His friends were trying to catch up with him. But then, Tim smelled the sweet smell of the cake from the oven. He stopped racing and ran back to his house. His friends followed him, and they all enjoyed the delicious cake. Tim was grateful for the cake and for his friends who loved to race with him.
