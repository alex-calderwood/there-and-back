Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. Tim loved to play in the dirt. One day, Tim got very dirty. His hands, face, and clothes were all covered in dirt. Tim's mom saw him and said, "Oh, Tim! You are so dirty! Let's go inside and clean up."
Inside the house, Tim's mom turned on the radio. They heard a fun song. Tim and his mom started to dance. Tim felt his muscles getting strong as he danced. He liked to move his arms and legs.
Tim's mom had an idea. She took out a big box with a red button. "This is a record box," she said. "We can record our dance and listen to it later." Tim pressed the red button, and they danced some more. When they were done, Tim's mom pressed the button again. They listened to their dance, and it made them smile. Tim loved his strong muscles and the fun they had with the record box.
