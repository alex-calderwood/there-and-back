Once upon a time, there was a busy ant named Tim. Tim liked to help his friends. He always had a lot to do. One day, Tim found a hose. The hose was very long.
Tim had an idea. He thought the hose could help him increase the water for the plants. So, he put the hose near the plants and turned it on. The water came out fast and the plants were happy.
But then, something unexpected happened. The hose started to wiggle and dance! It was not a hose, but a big, friendly snake! The snake helped Tim water the plants every day. And they all lived happily ever after.
