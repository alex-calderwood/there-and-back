One day, a smart cat and a little dog were playing in the park. They saw a big box. The cat said, "I can carry this box." The dog said, "No, I can carry it."
The cat tried to carry the box, but it was too heavy. The dog tried too, but it was too heavy for him as well. They both made a funny face as they tried to lift the box.
Just then, a tiny ant came by. The ant said, "I can help you carry the box." The cat and the dog laughed. "You are too small," they said. But the ant called all of his ant friends. Together, they carried the box with ease. The cat and the dog were very surprised and thanked the ants for their help.
