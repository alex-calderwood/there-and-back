Once upon a time, there was a girl named Ruby. She loved to explore near her home. One day, Ruby went out to play in the garden.
Ruby found a lemon tree! She was so excited. She wanted to see what was inside the lemon so she grabbed one. She couldn't open it on her own, so she asked her Mommy to help.
Mommy used a knife to cut the lemon open. Inside, Ruby saw it was filled with juicy, yellow pieces. Ruby put one in her mouth. It was so sour and tasted so bitter. She made a funny face!
The next day, Ruby and Mommy went to the beach. Ruby saw all the kids diving in the water. She wanted to try it, but she was scared.
Mommy said that she would help her. Mommy held her tight and they jumped into the water. Ruby felt so free! She loved it. She wanted to do it again and again. 
Ruby now dives into the water every time they go to the beach. It's so fun!
