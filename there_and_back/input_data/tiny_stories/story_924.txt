Once upon a time, there was a famous boy named Tim. Tim loved to swing on the big tree near his house. One day, he met a girl named Sue, who also loved to swing.
Tim said to Sue, "Let's have a swing race! We will see who has the most power to swing the highest!" Sue agreed and they started to swing.
As they both swung higher and higher, Tim tried to use all his power to win the race. But he swung too high and fell off the swing. Tim got hurt and cried. Sue stopped swinging and came to help him, but it was too late. The race had a bad ending.
