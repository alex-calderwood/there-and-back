The sun shone brightly in the sky and Max had fun playing with his friends. After some time, he decided to go and explore a temple he had seen from far away.
Max walked towards the temple and suddenly it seemed to him that the temple was shaking. He suddenly heard a loud grinding sound and he became scared.
When he came closer to the temple, Max noticed someone inside. It was a old woman and she was angry. Max was so frightened by her expression that he could not even speak.
"What are you doing here?" the woman said in an angry voice. Max looked at her in fear and said, "I was just looking at the temple."
The woman seemed to soften a little as she looked at Max. "Well, I guess it's okay for you to look. Just be careful not to get too close."
Max smiled and thanked the woman for her advice. He waved goodbye to the woman and ran back home, feeling happy and relieved.
