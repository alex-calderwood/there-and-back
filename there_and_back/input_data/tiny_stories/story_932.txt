Once, there was a bald man who had a trade. He liked to load things. Every morning, he went to the store to load things up and bring them home. Every day, he would load up bigger and bigger things like chairs and tables. One day, he was loading a very big table. It was so big that he couldn't carry it himself. Suddenly, he saw a little 3-year-old girl looking at him. He asked the girl if she could help him. Together, they loaded the table onto the truck. Then, the man thanked the little girl for her help and drove away. The little girl went home with a smile on her face. From that day on, the bald man and the little girl were friends. They helped each other with loading things many more times and became the best of friends.
