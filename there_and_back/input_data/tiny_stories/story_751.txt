One day, a little girl named Mia went to the zoo with her mom. Mia was so happy because she loved to see all the animals. She saw a big leopard in a cage. The leopard was warm from the sun. Mia wanted to be friends with the leopard.
Mia said to the leopard, "Hi, Mr. Leopard. Do you want to be my friend?" The leopard looked at Mia and nodded its head. Mia smiled and felt happy.
Later that day, Mia received a toy leopard from her mom. Mia hugged the toy and said, "Now I have a friend just like the leopard at the zoo." Mia and her toy leopard played together all day and became best friends.
