Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very independent for his age. He liked to do things by himself. One day, Tim went outside to play in his yard.
While playing, Tim saw a big missile in the sky. He stared at it with his big eyes. The missile went up, up, up into the sky. Tim wondered where it was going.
Then, something unexpected happened. The missile turned into a big, shiny balloon! Tim was so happy and surprised. He stared at the balloon and smiled. The balloon floated down to Tim, and he played with it all day.
