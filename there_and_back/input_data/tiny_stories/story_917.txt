One day, a boy named Tim found a big, hairy bug. He was scared but wanted to show it to his friend, Sue. So, Tim put the bug in a wrap to carry it.
When Tim got to Sue's house, he said, "Look what I found! It's a big, hairy bug!" Sue was brave and wanted to see the bug. Tim opened the wrap, but the bug was gone!
Just then, Tim saw the bug on the table. The bug had a small pen and was writing with it! Tim and Sue were very surprised. They never saw a bug that could write before. They became friends with the bug and had fun playing together.
