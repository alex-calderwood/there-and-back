Once there was a boy who lived in a small village. Every day he would look up at the bright sky filled with twinkling stars and dream of finding a diamond. One morning he set off on an adventure in search of the treasure. After walking for hours the boy finally spotted a diamond lying in the grass. He bent over to pick it up and wiped the dirt from its cold surface. He was filled with joy and clutched the diamond tight in his hand. 
The boy hurried home, but on the way he saw a large group of people gathered around a man in a warm cloak. As he got closer he could see the man had a bag of golden coins and he was offering it to anyone who could answer his riddle. The boy stepped forward and shouted out the answer. The man was surprised and handed the boy the bag of coins. 
But little did the boy know it was a trick. As he walked away, the man suddenly grabbed him from behind. He snatched away the diamond from the boy's hand and wiped it clean. The man laughed, and the boy realised he had been tricked. He begged for the diamond back, but the man had already disappeared. 
The boy sadly returned home without the diamond, never to get it back again.
