Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big round thing on the grass. It is brown and soft.
"What is that?" Anna asks.
"Let's go and look," Ben says.
They run to the round thing. It is a big pillow. Someone left it there. Anna and Ben touch it. It is very comfortable.
"Can we sit on it?" Anna asks.
"Sure, why not?" Ben says.
They sit on the pillow. They feel happy and cozy. They talk and laugh. They pretend they are on a cloud.
"Look, a bird!" Ben says. He points to the sky.
"Wow, it is so pretty!" Anna says. She sees a blue bird.
They watch the bird fly away. They smile at each other. They like the big round pillow. They like the park. They like being friends.
