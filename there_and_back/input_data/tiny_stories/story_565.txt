One day, a group of kids went to class. The class was very boring. The teacher talked and talked, but the kids just wanted to play.
At lunch, the kids had an idea. They decided to gather all their toys and play together. They brought balls, dolls, and toy cars. They played and laughed, and the boring class was forgotten.
After lunch, the teacher saw the kids playing. She thought about how to make the class more fun. The next day, she brought fun games to class. The kids were happy, and the class was not boring anymore.
