Once upon a time, there was a gifted little girl named Lily. She could do many things well. One day, she saw a cat stuck in a tree. Lily wanted to help the cat, so she began to rush to the tree.
As she got closer, she saw the cat was scared. Lily knew she had to be gentle to help the cat. She slowly climbed the tree and got the cat. When she brought the cat down, it was very happy. It licked Lily's hand with its mouth.
Lily learned that even when you want to rush and help, sometimes you need to slow down and be kind. This way, you can help others better. The moral of the story is to be patient and gentle when helping others.
