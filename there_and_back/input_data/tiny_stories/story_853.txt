Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a favorite toy named Bunny. Lily and Bunny were always together. They played games, ate food, and took naps. They were very comfortable with each other.
One day, Lily and Bunny went to the park. They played on the swings and the slide. They had so much fun. But then, Lily saw a big dog. The dog was loud and it scared her. She wanted to gain some quiet time with Bunny.
Lily and Bunny went to a quiet spot under a big tree. They sat down and enjoyed the quiet. Lily felt safe and comfortable with Bunny. They listened to the birds and the wind. Lily was happy that she and Bunny could find a quiet place. And they lived happily ever after.
