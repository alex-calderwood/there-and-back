Once upon a time, there was a gray bunny named Bob. Bob liked to hop and kick his legs. One day, Bob went to a bridge to play.
At the bridge, Bob met a little bird named Tim. Tim was blue and liked to fly. They both wanted to play together. So, Bob said, "Let's play a game!"
Bob and Tim played a fun game. Bob would kick a small ball and Tim would fly to catch it. They laughed and had a great time. The sun was shining and they played all day.
At the end of the day, Bob and Tim were tired. They sat by the bridge and talked. Bob said, "I had fun today!" Tim agreed, "Me too! Let's play again soon!" They both smiled and went home, excited to play together again.
