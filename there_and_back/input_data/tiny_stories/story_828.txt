Once upon a time, there was a dependable dog named Spot. Spot loved to play outside with his best friend, a little boy named Tim. One day, Tim and Spot were playing in the yard. They found a big box that looked like a television. They were very curious about it.
Tim and Spot decided to bury the television box in the yard. They dug a big hole and put the box inside. Then, they covered it with dirt. They thought it would be a fun surprise for later. They went back inside to eat lunch and take a nap.
A few days later, Tim and Spot remembered the television box they buried. They ran outside and dug up the box. They opened it and found a brand new, shiny television inside. Tim and Spot were so excited! They knew it was a special surprise just for them. They took the television inside and watched their favorite shows together.
