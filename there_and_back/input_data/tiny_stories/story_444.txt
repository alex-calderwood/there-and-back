Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He was enthusiastic about helping his mom in the kitchen. One day, his mom was making a cake. Tim wanted to help, so his mom let him.
Tim's mom told him, "Tim, we need butter. Can you get it from the fridge?" Tim said, "Yes, mom!" He went to the fridge and got the butter. But on his way back, Tim saw his toy car. He wanted to play with it. So, he delayed bringing the butter to his mom.
After a while, his mom called out, "Tim, where is the butter?" Tim remembered he forgot to bring it. He quickly brought the butter to his mom. The cake was almost done, but because Tim delayed, the cake was not as good as it could be.
Tim learned that when you help someone, you should not delay. If you delay, things might not turn out as good as they could be. Tim promised to do better next time.
