Once upon a time, there lived a man. He had a wife that he loved very much. One day, his wife had a surprise for him. She said she had something that belonged to him. The man was very excited! 
He asked his wife, "What is it? What do I belong to?" His wife smiled and said, "You belong to a family now." When the man heard this, he was even more excited! His wife handed him a picture of a beautiful baby boy. The man was in shock. 
He said, "Our baby! I'm so excited! Is this really ours?" His wife nodded her head and said, "Yes, our son! You now belong to a family of three!" The man was so happy and hugged his wife tightly. He was now so excited to be a dad! They both smiled and celebrated the joyous moment.
