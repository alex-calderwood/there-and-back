Once upon a time there lived two girls who lived in the same universe. One of the girls had a very big supply of toys. The other girl was very jealous of the toys.
One day the jealous girl asked her friend to share her toys. But the other girl said that she needed all her toys. The jealous girl got very upset and began to cry.
Suddenly a magic fairy appeared! She said that she could supply the jealous girl with lots of toys. She waved her wand and lots of wonderful toys and games appeared.
The two girls were so happy! They played with the toys every day and they both had enough to share. From then on, they were best friends.
