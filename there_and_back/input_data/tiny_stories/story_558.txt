One day, a little girl named Lily was playing outside. It was getting dark, and the night was coming. Lily's mom called her to come inside, but Lily wanted to keep playing. She said, "Mom, I am brave! I can play outside at night!"
Lily's mom was worried but let her play for a little bit longer. As Lily played, she saw a big shadow. She was scared, but she wanted to be brave. She said to the shadow, "I am not scared of you! Go away!"
The shadow moved closer, and it was a big, friendly dog. The dog said, "Woof!" and wagged its tail. Lily was happy and pet the dog. She was brave, and now she had a new friend. They played together until Lily's mom called her inside for bedtime.
