Once upon a time, there was a playful sailor named Sam. Sam had a big boat. He loved to sail on the water. One day, Sam saw a big, soft spot on the beach. He thought it was a nice place to lay down and rest.
Sam said to his friend, "Look! A nice spot to lay down. Let's rest here for a while." They both went to the beach and lay down. They looked at the sky and saw big, puffy clouds. They felt happy and relaxed.
But then, Sam heard a strange sound. He sat up and saw a big wave coming. He knew it was time to go. Sam quickly said, "We have to go now! The big wave is coming!" They ran to their boat and sailed away just in time. The big wave hit the beach, but Sam and his friend were safe on their boat. They smiled at each other, happy that they had left the beach in time.
