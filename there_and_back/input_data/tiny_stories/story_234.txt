One day, a girl named Mia went to the park. She saw a big blue ball near the swings. Mia picked it up and started to play with it. She had a good time kicking and throwing the ball. She felt very happy.
As Mia played, she saw a little boy observe her. The boy looked sad. Mia thought maybe he lost his ball. She decided to do a good thing and give the ball to the boy. The boy's face lit up with a big smile.
But then, the boy's mom came over and said, "That's not our ball. We have a red ball." Mia and the boy looked at each other and laughed. They played with both the blue and red balls together. They became good friends and had a fun day at the park.
