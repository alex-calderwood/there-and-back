One day, a little girl named Emma found a big, red bag. She thought it was amazing. She wanted to know what was inside the bag. So, she opened it. Inside the bag, she found a small toy drum and two sticks. She was very happy.
Emma started to play the drum. She played it loud and fast. She made her own music. Her friend Sam came over and asked, "What are you doing, Emma?" She said, "I am playing my amazing drum. I found it in this red bag." Sam wanted to play too. So, they played the drum together. They had a lot of fun.
As they played, something unexpected happened. The drum began to glow. With every clap, it got brighter and brighter. Suddenly, a friendly talking bird came out of the drum. The bird said, "Thank you for playing the drum. I was trapped inside, and your music set me free." Emma and Sam were surprised but happy to help. The bird flew away with a big smile, and they continued to play the drum, knowing they did something good.
