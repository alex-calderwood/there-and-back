Once upon a time, there was a cool cat named Tom. Tom lived in a big house with his best friend, a little girl named Lilly. Lilly loved the color pink and had a big pink room.
One day, Lilly painted Tom's fur pink while he was sleeping. When Tom woke up, he looked in the mirror and saw his pink fur. He did not like it at all. Tom started to feel very sad.
Tom said, "I hate being pink!" Lilly saw Tom was sad and wanted to help. She gave Tom a bath to wash the pink away. Tom was happy to be his normal color again. They played together and had lots of fun.
