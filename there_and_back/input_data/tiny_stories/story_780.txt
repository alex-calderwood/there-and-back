Once upon a time, there was a crazy butterfly. It had big, pretty wings with many colors. The butterfly liked to fly all around the forest.
One day, the butterfly saw a big stick. It wanted to measure the stick. The butterfly flew up and down, trying to see how long the stick was.
While measuring the stick, the butterfly did not see a big spider web. It got caught in the web. The spider came and the butterfly could not fly away. That was the end of the crazy butterfly.
