Once there was a boy named Tim. Tim had a red kayak. He loved to play with his kayak in the water. One day, the sky was bad. It was very dark and windy. Tim wanted to play with his kayak, but his mom said no.
Tim was sad. He asked his mom, "Why can't I play with my kayak?" His mom said, "The wind is too strong. It is not safe." Tim looked outside and saw the trees moving a lot.
Later, the bad sky went away. The sun came out and the wind stopped. Tim's mom said, "Now you can play with your kayak." Tim was very happy. He took his kayak to the water and played all day.
