Once upon a time in a small town, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved the summer days when she could play outside with her friends. One day, Lily saw her mom wearing a fancy dress. Lily wanted to wear a fancy dress too, so she asked her mom, "Can I have a fancy dress like yours?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, my dear. We can make a fancy dress for you." They went to the store and bought some pretty fabric. Lily was so happy.
Together, they made a fancy dress for Lily. When it was done, Lily put on her new dress and looked in the mirror. She saw that her shoes did not match her dress. She asked her mom, "Can we find shoes that match my dress?" Her mom said, "Of course!" They found matching shoes and Lily felt so fancy in her new dress and shoes. She played outside all summer long, feeling like a princess in her fancy dress.
