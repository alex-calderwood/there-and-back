Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sue. She had a job to deliver healthy food in a basket to people. Sue liked her job because she could help others.
One day, she had to take a basket to a big house on a hill. She walked up the hill with her basket, feeling happy. Sue knocked on the door, and a kind old lady opened it. The old lady was very happy to see Sue and her basket.
As Sue gave the basket to the old lady, something unexpected happened. A big wind came and blew the basket away! The healthy food fell out of the basket and went everywhere. Sue and the old lady were sad because they could not eat the healthy food. The wind had taken it all away. And that was the end of the story.
