Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and run. They saw a big dog near the fence. The dog was dirty and had long teeth. It barked loud and ran to them.
"Help! The dog will scare us!" Lily cried.
"Run, Lily, run!" Tom said. They ran to the other way of the park. They looked for a safe place to hide.
They found a small house under a tree. It was made of wood and had a door and a window. They opened the door and went inside. They hoped the dog would not find them.
The house was dark and dusty. There were old toys and books on the floor. Lily and Tom looked around. They saw a big spider on the wall. It had eight legs and many eyes. It moved fast and came to them.
"Help! The spider will scare us!" Tom cried.
"Run, Tom, run!" Lily said. They ran to the door and opened it. They saw the dog outside. It was still barking and running to them.
"Help! The dog and the spider will scare us!" Lily and Tom cried.
They ran to the street and saw a car. It was their mom's car. She was looking for them. She saw them and opened the door.
"Mom! Mom! Help us!" Lily and Tom said. They jumped into the car and hugged their mom.
"What happened, my sweeties?" Mom asked.
"There was a dirty dog and a big spider. They wanted to scare us. We were so afraid!" Lily and Tom said.
"Oh, you poor things! Don't worry, they can't hurt you now. You are safe with me. Let's go home and have some cookies and milk. You did well to run away and find a place to hide. I'm proud of you." Mom said.
She drove them home and gave them cookies and milk. She kissed them and hugged them. They felt happy and calm. They forgot about the dog and the spider. They only remembered their mom's love.
