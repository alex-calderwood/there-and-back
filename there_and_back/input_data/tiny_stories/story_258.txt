Lily and Tom were playing in the garden. They liked to dig and make holes in the soil. They found worms and bugs and stones. They had fun.
But then Lily saw a big flower pot. It had a pretty flower in it. Lily wanted the flower. She said to Tom, "Give me the flower. It is mine."
Tom said, "No, Lily. The flower is not yours. It is Mom's. She loves the flower. She waters it every day. You cannot take it."
Lily did not listen. She was angry. She pulled the flower out of the pot. She broke the stem. She threw the flower on the ground. She said, "I don't care. I want the flower."
Tom was sad. He saw the flower on the ground. He saw the soil in the pot. He saw Mom coming. He said, "Lily, you are silly. You hurt the flower. You hurt Mom. You are not nice."
Mom saw the flower on the ground. She saw the soil in the pot. She saw Lily and Tom. She said, "What happened? Who did this?"
Tom told Mom the truth. He said, "Lily did it. She wanted the flower. She took it. She broke it. She threw it."
Mom was angry. She said, "Lily, you are naughty. You did a bad thing. You cannot take things that are not yours. You cannot hurt things that are alive. You have to say sorry. You have to learn to share."
Lily felt sorry. She saw the flower on the ground. She saw the soil in the pot. She saw Mom's face. She said, "I am sorry, Mom. I am sorry, Tom. I was silly. I did not think. I will not do it again. Can I help you fix the flower?"
Mom said, "Thank you, Lily. I am glad you are sorry. But the flower is too broken. We cannot fix it. We have to throw it away. Maybe we can plant a new one. But you have to be careful. You have to be gentle. You have to be kind."
Lily said, "I will, Mom. I will, Tom. I will be careful. I will be gentle. I will be kind. I will share. I love you."
Mom said, "I love you too, Lily. I love you too, Tom. Come on, let's go inside. We can have some cookies and milk. And we can read a story. A story about flowers and friends."
The end.
