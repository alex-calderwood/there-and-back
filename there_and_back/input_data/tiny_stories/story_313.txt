Once upon a time, there was a tall tree. In the tree, there lived a big bird. The big bird had a long nose. One day, the big bird saw a little bird trying to carry a big stick to its nest. The little bird was very sad because the stick was too heavy.
The big bird said, "Little bird, let me help you carry the stick." The little bird replied, "Thank you, big bird!" So, the big bird used its long nose to help carry the stick. Together, they took the stick to the little bird's nest.
After that, the little bird was very happy. The big bird and the little bird became good friends. They played and helped each other every day. The moral of the story is to always help your friends when they need it.
