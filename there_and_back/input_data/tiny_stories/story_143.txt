One day, a lazy raven sat on a big tree. The sun was up, and the sky was blue. The raven did not want to fly. He just wanted to sit and rest.
A little boy named Tim saw the raven. He wanted to play with the bird. Tim picked up a small stick and poked the tree. "Hey, raven! Come down and play with me!" he said. The raven looked at Tim and said, "No, I am too lazy to play today."
Tim did not give up. He poked the tree again and again. The raven sighed and flew down. Tim and the raven played all day. They had so much fun! In the end, the lazy raven was happy that he played with Tim.
