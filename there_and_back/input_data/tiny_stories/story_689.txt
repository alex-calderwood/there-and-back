Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had to carry a big bag of rice to her grandma's house. Lily was very frustrated because the bag was heavy.
On her way, she met a big dog. The dog wanted to help Lily, but he didn't know how to carry the rice. Lily tried to show the dog how to help, but the dog couldn't do it.
In the end, the bag of rice broke and all the rice fell on the ground. Lily and the dog were sad because they could not take the rice to grandma's house. They went back home with nothing, feeling very frustrated.
