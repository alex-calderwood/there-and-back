The little girl was in the cozy kitchen with her mom. "Mom," she said. "Can we bake something?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, let's bake a cake." 
The little girl and her mom gathered all the ingredients and mixed them together in a bowl. Then the little girl scooped spoonfuls of the mix into a baking dish.
"I'm excited to eat it," the little girl said.
"It'll be ready in a few minutes," her mom said. "Why don't you go to the hall and wait?"
The little girl skipped down the hall and sat on a comfortable chair. She was so excited, she couldn't wait to eat the cake! 
When she returned to the kitchen, the smell of the freshly baked cake filled the air. She smiled as her mom set the cake on the table. They were both so happy that they shared a piece together. 
The little girl said, "Mom, that was by far the most comfortable cake I have ever eaten!"
