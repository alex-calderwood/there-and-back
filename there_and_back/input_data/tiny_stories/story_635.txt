Tim and Lily were playing hide and seek in the big house. Tim was the seeker and Lily was the hider. Lily ran up the stairs and looked for a good spot. She saw a dark room with a big closet. She opened the closet and went inside. She closed the door and waited for Tim to find her.
Tim counted to ten and started to look for Lily. He looked in the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, but he could not find her. He felt anxious. He did not want to lose Lily. He went up the stairs and saw the dark room. He was scared. He did not like dark rooms. He heard a noise from the closet. He thought it was a ghost. He screamed and ran away.
Lily heard Tim scream and ran out of the closet. She saw Tim running down the stairs. She called his name. "Tim, Tim, where are you going? It's me, Lily. I'm not a ghost. I was hiding in the closet."
Tim stopped and turned around. He saw Lily coming out of the dark room. He felt relieved. He was not anxious anymore. He ran back to Lily and hugged her. "Lily, I'm sorry. I thought you were a ghost. I was scared. I did not want to lose you."
Lily hugged him back. "It's okay, Tim. I'm sorry too. I did not mean to scare you. I did not know you did not like dark rooms. Let's play somewhere else."
They went downstairs and found a new game to play. They were happy and forgot about the dark room and the ghost. They did not lose each other. They were friends.
