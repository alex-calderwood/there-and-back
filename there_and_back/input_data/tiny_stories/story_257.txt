One day, a little girl named Lily was playing with her toy boat in the cold bathtub. She liked to watch it float and make waves with her hands. Her mom came in and said, "Lily, please remind me to fill the bathtub with warm water for your bath tonight."
That night, Lily's mom filled the bathtub with warm water. Lily jumped in and played with her toy boat again. She splashed and laughed, having lots of fun. But then, something unexpected happened.
A tiny fish appeared in the bathtub! It swam around Lily's toy boat, making her giggle. She said, "Hello, little fish! How did you get in my bathtub?" The fish smiled and swam away, leaving Lily to wonder where it came from.
