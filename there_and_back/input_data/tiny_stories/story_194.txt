One day, a pale girl named Amy went to the park with her mom. They saw a big fountain with water going up and down. Amy wanted to play near the fountain, so her mom said, "Okay, but don't get too wet!"
Amy walked near the fountain and saw a small, soft ball. She picked it up and gave it a big squeeze. To her surprise, the ball started to talk! "Hello, I'm Bally! Can you help me?" said the ball.
Amy was scared at first but then said, "Yes, I can help you. What do you need?" Bally replied, "I need to get back to my family on the other side of the park." Amy picked up Bally and carried him to the other side of the park. When they got there, Bally's family was so happy to see him. They thanked Amy for her help and gave her a big hug. From that day on, Amy and Bally became the best of friends.
