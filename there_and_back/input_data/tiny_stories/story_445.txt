Once upon a time, there was a big tank. The tank was very fit and strong. It lived in a small town with many friends. One day, the tank met a little boy named Tim. Tim was sad because his toy was broken.
"Hi Tim!" said the tank. "Why are you sad?"
"My toy is broken," Tim said. "I wish I could fix it."
"I can help you!" said the tank.
The tank used its strong arm to fix Tim's toy. Tim was very happy. He thanked the tank and they played together all day. They made sure not to destroy anything while playing. The tank and Tim became best friends and they lived happily ever after.
