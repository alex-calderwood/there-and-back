Once upon a time, there was a big bookcase in a room. The bookcase was full of colorful books. Every day, a little boy named Tim would pick a book and read with his mom. They loved reading together.
One day, Tim found a small, bouncy ball. He decided to play with it. He threw the ball and it started to bounce all around the room. It was so much fun! Tim laughed as he chased the ball.
As the ball bounced near the bookcase, Tim's mom asked him to be calm and play gently. She didn't want the books to fall. Tim listened and played calmly with the ball. They had a fun and safe day.
