Once upon a time, a boy named Tim went to the park. The park had a big slide, swings, and a sandbox. Tim liked to play on the slide because it was very smooth. He would go up and down the slide all day. He had so much fun.
One day, Tim saw a funny clown at the park. The clown made Tim laugh a lot. The clown had a big red nose and big shoes. Tim and the clown played on the slide and the swings. They had a lot of fun together.
But then, something unexpected happened. The clown took off his big red nose and big shoes. Under the clown clothes was Tim's dad! Tim was very sad because he wanted to play with the funny clown, not his dad. He went home and did not laugh anymore.
