Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and trucks. One day, Tom sees a new toy in Sam's room. It is a razor. It is shiny and sharp.
"Can I play with your razor?" Tom asks Sam.
"No, it is not a toy. It is for shaving. My dad gave it to me. He said I can use it when I grow up." Sam says.
"Please, just for a little bit. I will be careful. I want to see how it works." Tom begs.
Sam thinks for a moment. He likes to share with his friend, but he also likes his razor. He decides to lend it to Tom, but only for a little while.
"Okay, but you have to give it back soon. And don't touch the blade. It can hurt you." Sam says.
"Thank you, thank you!" Tom says. He takes the razor and runs to the bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror. He sees his messy hair and his smooth face. He wonders what he would look like with a beard.
He puts the razor on his cheek and slides it down. He feels a sting and sees a drop of blood. He screams.
Sam hears the scream and runs to the bathroom. He sees Tom holding his face and crying. He sees the razor on the floor and the blood on the sink. He is angry and scared.
"What did you do? You cut yourself! You are not supposed to use the razor! Give it back to me!" Sam shouts.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It hurts! I just wanted to try it!" Tom says.
Sam grabs the razor and puts it in his pocket. He gets a band-aid and puts it on Tom's cheek. He tells him to stop crying and to go home. He says he is not his friend anymore.
Tom feels sad and sorry. He says he is sorry again and leaves. He walks home with his head down. He wishes he had not played with the razor. He wishes he had not made Sam mad. He wishes he had listened to him. He hopes he can be his friend again.
