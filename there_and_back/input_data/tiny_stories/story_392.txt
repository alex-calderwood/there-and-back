Once upon a time, there was a chubby little dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and play all day long. He would jump and wag his tail, always happy and full of energy.
One day, Spot found a big red ball on the floor. He was so excited! He pushed the ball with his nose and chased it all around the house. The ball would bounce and roll, and Spot would run after it, barking with joy.
After playing with the ball for a long time, Spot started to feel tired. He decided it was time to settle down for a nap. He found a soft and cozy spot on the floor, curled up, and closed his eyes. Spot had sweet dreams about playing with his big red ball all day long.
