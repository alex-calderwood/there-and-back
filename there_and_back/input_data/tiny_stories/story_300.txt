Once upon a time, there was a big, enthusiastic dog named Max. Max loved to play and run. One day, Max found a small notebook on the ground. He picked it up with his mouth and carried it to his friend, a little girl named Lily.
Max gave the notebook to Lily. "Wow, thank you, Max!" said Lily with a big smile. They sat down under a tree to draw in the notebook. Lily drew a picture of Max, and Max tried to draw a picture of Lily with his paw. They laughed and played with the notebook.
As the sun began to set, Max started to feel tired. He let out a big yawn. "Are you sleepy, Max?" asked Lily. Max nodded his head. So, they put the notebook away and lay down under the tree. Max and Lily closed their eyes and fell asleep, dreaming of more fun days together.
