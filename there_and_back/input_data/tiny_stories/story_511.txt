Lily and Ben were playing in the pool. They liked to dive and splash and swim. They had a task to find the hidden toys that mom threw in the water. Lily was good at diving. She could hold her breath for a long time and see the toys at the bottom. Ben was not so good at diving. He was scared of the deep water and the dark.
"Look, I found a duck!" Lily said, holding up the yellow toy. "Can you find the frog?"
Ben shook his head. He did not want to dive. He wanted to stay in the shallow water and play with the ball.
"Come on, Ben, it's fun!" Lily said. "Don't be a baby. I'll help you. Just follow me."
Lily grabbed Ben's hand and pulled him to the deep end. Ben tried to resist, but Lily was stronger. She dove with him, holding his hand. Ben felt the water go over his head. He felt scared. He wanted to breathe. He wanted to go back up. He tried to let go of Lily's hand, but she held on tight.
"Look, there's the frog!" Lily said, pointing to the green toy. "Grab it, Ben!"
Ben did not care about the frog. He cared about the air. He opened his mouth and screamed. Water filled his mouth and nose. He choked and coughed. He felt pain in his chest. He felt dizzy. He blacked out.
Lily did not notice. She was happy. She had found the frog. She let go of Ben's hand and swam up with the toy. She smiled and shouted.
"Mom, look, I found the frog! I did the task! Where's Ben?"
Mom looked at the pool. She saw Ben's body floating in the water. She screamed and jumped in. She grabbed Ben and pulled him out. She tried to make him breathe. She called for help. But it was too late. Ben was gone. Lily had killed him.
