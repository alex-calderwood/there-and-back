Once upon a time, there was a gloomy day. A big war was going on between the animals in the forest. The birds and the bugs were not happy. They wanted to take back their home from the big, bad animals.
One bird said to the other, "We need to take our home back! Let's talk to the big, bad animals." The other bird agreed, and they went to talk to the big, bad animals. They told them, "We don't want to fight. We want to be friends."
But then, something unexpected happened! The big, bad animals said they were sorry. They didn't know they were making the birds and bugs sad. They said, "We will help you take your home back." They all worked together and fixed the forest.
From that day on, the big, bad animals were not bad anymore. They became friends with the birds and bugs. They all lived happily ever after in the forest. The gloomy day turned into a bright and happy day.
