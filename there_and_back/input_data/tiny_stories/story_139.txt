One day, Tim and Sue went to the park. Tim found a ball that had a funny texture. It was not like other balls. Sue said, "This ball feels fake!"
They wanted to solve the problem of the fake ball. Tim and Sue asked their friend, Max. Max said, "I don't know. Let's ask my big sister, Lily."
Lily looked at the ball and laughed. She said, "This is not a ball, it's an egg!" Tim, Sue, and Max were very surprised. They did not expect the ball to be an egg. They put the egg back in a safe place and went home.
