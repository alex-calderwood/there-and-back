Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to play at the gym. He liked to jump, run, and have fun with his friends. Tim was always happy when he was at the gym.
One day, a new girl came to the gym. Her name was Sue. Sue was shy and didn't know anyone. Tim saw Sue and wanted to help her. He went to her and said, "Hi, my name is Tim. Do you want to play with me?" Sue smiled and said, "Yes, thank you!"
Tim and Sue played together all day. They jumped, ran, and had a lot of fun. Sue was very grateful to Tim for being her friend. She was happy that Tim was so kind to her. 
The other kids at the gym saw how Tim and Sue were having fun. They learned that being kind and helping others can make everyone happy. From that day on, all the kids at the gym were kind to each other and they all played together.
The moral of the story is to always be kind and help others, because it can make everyone happy.
