Once upon a time, there was a popular bird named Bobo. Bobo liked to play with his friends in the big tree. They would fly and sing all day long.
One day, Bobo saw the sunrise. The sky was red, orange, and yellow. It was so pretty! Bobo wanted to play a new game with his friends. He had an idea to shoot seeds from his beak like a game.
Bobo and his friends played the new game. They would shoot seeds at each other and try to catch them. It was so much fun! All the birds in the big tree loved to play the seed game at sunrise. And Bobo was happy because he could play with his friends every day.
