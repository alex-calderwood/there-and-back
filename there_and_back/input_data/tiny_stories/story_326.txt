Once upon a time, there was a gray cat named Fluffy. Fluffy loved to play outside. One day, Fluffy saw a small flame in the grass. The flame was hungry and asked Fluffy for help.
"Please feed me," said the flame. Fluffy did not know what to do. He was scared of the flame, but he did not want it to be hungry. Fluffy thought and thought. He remembered that his friend, the dog, might know what to do.
Fluffy went to the dog and told him about the hungry flame. The dog knew just what to do. "We need to give the flame some wood," said the dog. So, Fluffy and the dog took some wood to the flame. The flame ate the wood and grew bigger and happier.
In the end, Fluffy and the dog learned that helping others can be good, even if it is a little scary. The flame became their friend, and they all played together in the grass.
