Once upon a time, there was a mild animal named Ralph. Ralph always liked to nap in the middle of the day. He said goodbye to his friends then quietly snuggled into a patch of grass and closed his eyes. As he began to nap, his friends started to worry. They knew something was coming, but they just couldn't put their fingers on it.
As Ralph snoozed, the sky suddenly darkened and a loud rumbling filled the air. Startled, Ralph quickly awoke and looked around. He asked his friends, "What is happening?" 
His friend Jake answered, "It's a storm, Ralph. We should get out of the way so we don't get hurt." 
Ralph was scared, but listened to his friends. He followed them away from the grass, but they were too late. The storm passed, but Ralph had been struck by a heavy bolt of lightning! 
All of Ralph's friends were very scared and sad. But then something unexpected happened. Ralph opened his eyes and said, "That was a mild nap." Everyone was shocked and relieved that Ralph was ok! They were so glad that Ralph was able to survive the storm.
