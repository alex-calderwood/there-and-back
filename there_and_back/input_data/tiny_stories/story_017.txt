One day, a boy named Tim wanted to stay at home and watch TV. His mom said it was okay, but he had to be nice and not rude. Tim was happy and sat on the floor to watch his favorite show.
While Tim was watching TV, his little sister, Sue, came into the room. She wanted to watch her show too. Tim did not want to share the TV, and he was being rude to Sue. Sue started to cry.
Mom heard the cry and came into the room. She saw that Tim was being rude and not sharing the TV. Mom told Tim to be nice and share with Sue. Tim said sorry and let Sue watch her show too. They both stayed and watched TV together, and they were happy.
