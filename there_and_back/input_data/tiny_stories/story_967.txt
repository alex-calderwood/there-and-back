Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with red fruits. They want to pick some fruits and make jam.
They climb the tree and fill a basket with fruits. But when they want to go down, they see a big dog. The dog is angry and barks loud. Tom and Mia are scared. They do not know what to do.
Sam is a boy who lives near the park. He likes animals. He hears the dog and the children. He runs to the tree and sees Tom and Mia. He has a blue rope in his hand. He throws the rope to Tom and Mia and tells them to hold it. He pulls the rope and helps them down. The dog runs away.
Tom and Mia are happy. They thank Sam and give him some fruits. They go to Mia's house and make jam with the fruits. They share the jam with Sam and have a picnic. They are good friends. They like the blue rope. They call it the rescue rope.
