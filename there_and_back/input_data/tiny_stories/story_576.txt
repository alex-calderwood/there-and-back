Once, there was a beautiful bear who owned lots of beans. He wanted to give some to his friends, so he started picking them, one by one. He chose the plumpest, the reddest and the greenest beans. He wanted to make sure they were special!
The bear put the beans in a big basket and went around giving them to all his friends. Everyone was happy and thanked him for the lovely beans.
Soon there were no beans left in the basket and the bear realised he had given them all away. He smiled, happy that he had helped his friends and shared his beans.
He decided to pick some more beans from the ground, so he could give them away again. The bear was so happy - he loved to own beautiful beans!
