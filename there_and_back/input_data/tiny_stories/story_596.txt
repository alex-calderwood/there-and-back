Once upon a time, there was a little bird. It loved to soar in the sky so it could feel free. Every day it flew over the green fields and bright blue ocean.
Then one day it flew into a cartoon. The colours were so colourful and everything moved around and made fun noises. The little bird watched the characters dance and play and it felt so happy.
But then it was time for the bird to keep soaring. It sparkled in the sunlight and flew around until it was time to go back to its nest. The little bird had enjoyed its time in the cartoon, and knew it would come back soon.
And so, the little bird kept soaring in the sky and never forgot the special cartoon that it had visited.
