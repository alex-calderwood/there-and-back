Once upon a time there was a young girl named Lulu. One day, she decided to go on an adventure. She grabbed her coat and ran outside. As she ran, she started to see a strange house in the distance. She had never seen the house before! She walked closer and closer, until she saw her parents enter.
Lulu was so excited to see her parents that she ran in after them. When she entered the house, she discovered it was a magical playground! There were slides, swings and a sandbox filled with sand! 
Lulu was amazed by the playground and started to explore it. She ran to a slide and said "Wheeee!" Then, she saw a swing and said "Push me, parent!" 
Her parents smiled and gave her a push. Then, they both watched as Lulu flew through the air, laughing with joy. 
When it was time to go, Lulu said goodbye to the playground. But she promised herself that she would come back to explore again soon!
