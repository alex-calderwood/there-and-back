Once there was a little girl named Lana. She was always very generous, and liked to give people hugs. One day, Lana went to the grocery store and saw a calendar. She thought it looked nice, so she asked her mom if she could buy it. Her mom told her no, so Lana started to cry.
Lana kept crying and crying. Her mom was getting upset, so she said that if Lana stopped crying she would be able to buy the calendar. Lana stopped crying and they went to the checkout.
When they got home, Lana was so excited that she opened the calendar right away. But when she opened it, she saw that nothing was written on it. She started crying again, because she thought it was broken. 
Her mom tried to calm her down and told her that it was empty so that she could write on it. She had been very generous when she was at the store, and the shopkeeper had given her the empty calendar as a present.
But Lana was still upset, and she started crying again. No matter how hard her mom tried, Lana wouldn't stop. In the end, Lana was too upset to enjoy the generous gift.
