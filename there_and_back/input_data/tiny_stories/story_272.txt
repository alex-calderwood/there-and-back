Once upon a time, there was a nice lab. In the lab, there was a big tub. A dog and a cat lived in the lab. The dog was big, and the cat was small. They were friends.
One day, the dog and the cat wanted to bathe in the tub. The dog said, "I want to bathe first!" The cat said, "No, I want to bathe first!" They were not happy. They did not want to share the tub.
Then, a wise bird came to the lab. The bird said, "Why not bathe together?" The dog and the cat thought about it. They decided to try. They got into the tub and had fun. They splashed and played.
In the end, the dog and the cat learned to share. They were happy friends again. The moral of the story is: sharing is nice.
