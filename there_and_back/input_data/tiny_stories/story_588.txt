Once upon a time, there was a girl named Sue. Sue had a big brother named Sam. They loved to play together. One day, they played dress-up. Sam put on a scary mask and Sue wore a pretty dress. 
Sam said, "Boo! I am a scary monster!" Sue laughed and said, "I am a princess, and I will marry a prince!" Sam took off his scary mask and said, "I will be your prince!" They pretended to have a big wedding.
Later, their mom called them for dinner. Sue told her mom about the wedding game. Mom smiled and said, "You two will always be the best brother and sister." Sam and Sue hugged each other and knew they would always have fun together.
