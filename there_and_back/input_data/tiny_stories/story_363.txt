Once upon a time, there was a very nosy insect. The insect liked to try new things. One day, it saw a big red ball in the yard. The insect wanted to play with the ball.
The insect tried to push the ball with its legs. But the ball would not move. The insect tried harder and harder. Suddenly, the ball moved a little bit. The insect was so happy.
But then, something unexpected happened. The ball opened up! Inside the ball, there was a tiny frog. The frog said, "Thank you for helping me out of the ball!" The insect and the frog became best friends and played together every day.
