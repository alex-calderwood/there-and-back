There was a beautiful park. Two children ran around and played on a big bench. One of them looked up at the sky and shouted very loudly. The other child jumped off the bench and tried to lift it up. He was so strong, he managed to lift the heavy bench all the way up in the air and then he put it down again. The two children laughed and ran around the park, jumping on and off the bench as they played.
