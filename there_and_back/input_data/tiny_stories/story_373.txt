Ben and Lily were twins who lived in a big house on a hill. They liked to play outside and gaze at the valley below. They could see many things: trees, flowers, animals, and a river.
One day, they decided to go down the hill and explore the valley. They asked their mom if they could go, and she said yes, but they had to be careful and come back before dark. They put on their hats and shoes and ran down the hill.
They had fun in the valley. They picked some berries, chased some butterflies, and splashed in the river. They saw a big bridge that crossed the river and wanted to go over it. But when they got closer, they saw that the bridge was old and weak. Some of the planks were broken and some of the ropes were loose.
Ben was brave and said he wanted to cross the bridge. Lily was scared and said he shouldn't. She said the bridge might fall and he might get hurt. Ben said he was not afraid and he could do it. He said Lily was a baby and he was a big boy.
He stepped on the bridge and started to walk. Lily watched him and felt worried. She wanted him to come back. She called his name and told him to stop. But Ben did not listen. He wanted to show Lily that he was strong and brave.
He walked halfway across the bridge, but then he heard a loud crack. One of the planks snapped and he lost his balance. He screamed and grabbed a rope, but the rope was weak too. It broke and he fell into the river. Lily saw him fall and screamed too. She ran to the edge of the bridge and looked for him. She saw him in the water, struggling and crying. She was very scared and did not know what to do. She wished their mom was there to help them.
