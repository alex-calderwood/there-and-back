Once upon a time, there was a mighty star. The star was big and bright in the night sky. All the people in the town looked up at the star and smiled. It made them feel happy and safe.
One day, a little boy named Tim saw the star and said, "Star, please shut your light off. I want to sleep." The star heard Tim and felt sad. The star didn't want to make Tim unhappy, so it shut its light off.
But when the star shut its light off, the town became dark and scary. The people could not see where they were going. They missed the bright light of the mighty star. The star felt bad, but it couldn't turn its light back on. The town stayed dark and sad forever.
