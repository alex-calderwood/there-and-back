Once upon a time, there was a cheap toy boat. A boy named Tim loved to play with it. One day, Tim took his boat to the sea to play.
Tim liked to push his boat into the water. The boat would float on the tide and come back to him. Tim laughed and clapped his hands when the boat came back.
But one day, the tide was very strong. Tim pushed his boat into the water, but it did not come back. The boat went far, far away. Tim was sad and cried. His cheap toy boat was gone forever.
