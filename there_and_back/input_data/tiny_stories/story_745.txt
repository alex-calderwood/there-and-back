One day, a little boy named Tim found a black book. It was a new story, a novel, that he had never seen before. He was very excited to read it. Tim opened the book and saw many big words. He did not understand the words. Tim felt sad.
Tim went to his mom and said, "Mom, I found a black novel, but I can't read it. The words are too big." His mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, Tim. I will help you read it. We will increase your reading skills."
Tim and his mom read the black novel together every day. As they read, Tim learned new words. His reading skills increased. Tim was happy. He could now read the black novel all by himself.
