Jack and James were best friends. One day, they were walking down the street, when they saw a barber. The barber was shaving a man's beard. Jack and James wanted to have a turn. 
But the barber said no. He said the scissors were only for grownups.
Jack and James were mad. So they started to fight. They pushed and punched each other, until they were wet with sweat. 
Suddenly, the barber stepped in between them. He said fighting was not a good thing to do. He said that grownups should help children, not fight. 
The barber was right. So Jack and James hugged each other and were friends again. They thanked the barber for helping them. 
The end.
