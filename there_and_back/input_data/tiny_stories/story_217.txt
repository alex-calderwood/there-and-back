One sunny day, Mama and her three-year-old daughter went to the park. Mama was feeling very relaxed. The daughter was walking in front of her. Suddenly, she saw a bald stranger. The little girl stopped and looked at him curiously. Mama was slightly worried.
The bald stranger started walking closer to them. Mama reached out and held her daughter's hand. The bald man then started to speak. He said, "I know who you are."
Mama felt her heart start to race. She tried to stay calm. She asked the man who he was but the stranger just smiled. Mama grabbed the little girl and started to run. The bald man started to chase after them. Unfortunately, they couldn't get away. The bald stranger caught up to them and snatched the little girl away.
Mama screamed and held out her hands. But it was too late. The bald stranger disappeared with her daughter. Mama stood there in shock and despair, feeling helpless. She would never see her daughter again.
