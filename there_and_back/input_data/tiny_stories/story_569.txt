Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big package near the slide. They want to know what is inside.
"Let's race to the package!" Tom says. "The first one to get there can open it."
"OK!" Sam says. "Ready, set, go!"
They run as fast as they can. Tom is a little bit faster than Sam. He reaches the package first. He pulls the string and opens the box.
"Wow!" Tom says. "Look what I found!"
He takes out a toy car. It is red and shiny. It has four wheels and a horn. Tom likes cars. He is very happy.
Sam is sad. He wanted to open the package too. He wanted to find a toy. He feels terrible.
"That's not fair!" Sam says. "You got the car and I got nothing!"
He starts to cry. He does not want to play with Tom anymore.
Tom sees that Sam is crying. He feels sorry for him. He does not want to make Sam sad. He likes Sam. He wants to share with him.
"Hey, Sam, don't cry!" Tom says. "You can play with the car too. It is for both of us. We can take turns. We can race the car in the park. It will be fun!"
Sam stops crying. He looks at Tom. He sees that Tom is being nice. He smiles.
"Really?" Sam says. "You will share the car with me?"
"Of course!" Tom says. "You are my friend. Friends share."
He gives the car to Sam. Sam takes the car. He says thank you. He hugs Tom.
They are happy. They play with the car in the park. They race the car on the grass. They honk the horn. They laugh. They have fun. They are friends.
