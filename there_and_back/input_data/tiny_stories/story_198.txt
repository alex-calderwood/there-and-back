Lily loves to dance. She dances in her room, in the garden, and in the park. She dances with her dolls, her dog, and her friends. She dances when she is happy, when she is sad, and when she is bored.
One day, Lily sees a poster for a dance show. She wants to go and see the dancers. She asks her mom if they can go. Her mom says yes, and they buy tickets for the show.
On the day of the show, Lily wears her prettiest dress and shoes. She is very excited. She holds her mom's hand as they walk to the theater. She sees many people waiting to see the show. She feels a little nervous.
The show starts. Lily sees the dancers on the stage. They wear colorful costumes and move to the music. They jump, spin, and twirl. Lily thinks they are amazing. She claps and cheers for them.
Lily wants to dance like them. She stands up from her seat and tries to copy their moves. She jumps, spins, and twirls. She feels happy and proud. She does not see the people around her. She does not hear her mom telling her to sit down.
She does not notice the step in front of her. She stumbles and falls. She hurts her knee and her elbow. She cries and feels scared. She sees the people looking at her. She hears them whispering and laughing. She feels ashamed and sad.
Her mom picks her up and hugs her. She says, "It's okay, Lily. You are brave and beautiful. You are my little dancer. I am proud of you." She kisses her knee and her elbow. She gives her a tissue and a candy.
Lily stops crying and smiles. She says, "Thank you, mom. I love you. You are my best friend." She hugs her mom and eats her candy. She watches the rest of the show. She still loves to dance. She dances in her heart.
