Once upon a time, there was a parrot named Polly. Polly lived in a wide tree with her family. The tree was in a big forest with many animals.
One day, Polly saw a little boy playing near the tree. The boy was very close to a deep hole. Polly wanted to help the boy. She flew down from the tree and said, "Warn! Warn! Hole!"
The little boy heard Polly and stopped. He looked at the hole and then at Polly. He said, "Thank you, parrot!" The boy went back to his mom, and they left the forest.
Polly was very happy that she could help. She flew back to her wide tree and told her family. They were all proud of Polly. From that day on, the boy and Polly became good friends.
