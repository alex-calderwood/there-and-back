Once upon a time, there was a small brown dog named Max. Max had a big fan that he loved to play with. He liked to hold the fan in his mouth and run around the yard. Max had a friend, a little cat named Lily. Max and Lily liked to play together.
One day, Max and Lily were playing with the fan. Max held the fan in his mouth and ran fast. Lily tried to catch Max, but she was too slow. Max saw a big tree and thought it would be fun to jump over it. But Lily was scared of the tree. Max told Lily not to worry and that they would have more fun.
As Max jumped over the tree, the fan fell out of his mouth. Max and Lily looked for the fan, but they couldn't find it. They were very sad. Max thought he saw the fan near the tree, but it was just a big brown leaf. Max and Lily went home, feeling very upset. They never found the fan again.
