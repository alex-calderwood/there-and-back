Once upon a time, there was a boy. He had a phone that he liked very much. He liked to talk on it a lot. One cold and icy day, he went outside to play. He slipped on the ice and his phone flew from his hand. He tried to catch it, but it was too late. The phone slipped and slid into a river and was gone forever. That boy felt so sad! He would never have a phone again.
