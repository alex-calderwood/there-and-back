One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk in the park. It was the month of March, and the sun was shining bright. Tim was happy to see the flowers and the trees.
As Tim walked, he saw a small, sorry-looking cat. The cat was sad because it was lost. Tim wanted to help the cat, so he picked it up and started to look for its home. They walked and walked, but they could not find the cat's home.
Then, something unexpected happened. The cat started to change! It became bigger and bigger, and soon it was a big, friendly lion! The lion was not lost anymore, because it was a magic lion from the park. Tim was surprised but happy to have a new friend. They played in the park all day, and Tim was never sorry he helped the cat.
