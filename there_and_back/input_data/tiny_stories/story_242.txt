One day, a little bird was very excited. He wanted to dive from a tall building. He told his friends about his big plan. They all thought it was a great idea.
The little bird and his friends went to the tall building. They looked up and saw how high it was. The little bird was not scared. He knew he could do it. His friends cheered for him as he got ready to dive.
The little bird took a deep breath and jumped. He dove down, down, down from the tall building. His friends watched and clapped. The little bird was so happy he could do it. They all celebrated and played together for the rest of the day.
