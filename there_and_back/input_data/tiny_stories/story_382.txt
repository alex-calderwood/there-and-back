Once upon a time, there was a little goat named Gigi. Gigi lived in a small house with her best friend, a boy named Tim. One day, Tim went to play with his friends and left Gigi alone. Gigi felt sad and empty inside, so she decided to go on a walk.
While walking, Gigi met another goat named Gary. Gary looked mean and said, "This is my road! You must give me some food to pass." Gigi was scared, but she wanted to return home to Tim. So she said, "I don't have any food. Can I please go?"
Gary thought for a moment and then said, "Okay, you can pass. But you must return with food next time." Gigi was happy and ran back home. When Tim came back, he saw Gigi waiting for him. He hugged her and said, "I missed you, Gigi!"
From that day on, Gigi and Tim always made sure to have some food with them when they went for a walk. And if they met Gary again, they would share their food with him. This made Gigi feel happy and full of love, knowing that she had Tim by her side.
