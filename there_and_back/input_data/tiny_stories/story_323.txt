Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Ben. Ben was a very tough bear. He lived in a big forest with his mom and dad. One day, there was a big event in the forest. All the animals were going to play and have fun.
Ben's mom said, "Ben, you need to sleep before the event." Ben did not want to sleep. He was too excited. But his mom said, "You will be too tired if you don't sleep." So, Ben went to his bed and tried to sleep.
When Ben woke up, it was time for the event. All the animals were playing and having fun. Ben was so happy that he had slept because now he had lots of energy. He played with his friends all day long. At the end of the day, Ben said, "Thank you, Mom, for making me sleep. I had so much fun today!"
