Once upon a time, there was a generous man named Tom. Tom was a car driver. He had a license to drive his car. One day, he was driving down the street when he saw a little girl crying.
Tom stopped his car and asked, "Why are you crying, little girl?" The little girl said, "I lost my toy. Can you help me find it?" Tom said, "Of course, I will help you."
They looked for the toy together. They did not find the toy, but they found a big box. They opened the box and saw many toys inside. The little girl was very happy. She said, "Thank you, Tom!" Tom said, "You're welcome! Enjoy your new toys!" And that is how the story ends.
