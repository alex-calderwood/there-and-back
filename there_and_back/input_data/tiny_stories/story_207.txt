Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a clean, white house with her mom and dad. One day, her mom and dad called her and said, "Lily, we are going to a big maze today!"
Lily was so excited. She had never been to a maze before. When they got to the maze, Lily's mom and dad told her to be careful and not to get lost. They said they would call her name if they couldn't see her.
Lily went into the maze and had lots of fun. She turned left and right, but then she couldn't see her mom and dad anymore. She started to feel scared. But then, she heard her mom and dad call her name. She followed their voices and finally found them.
Lily was so happy to see her mom and dad again. They all laughed and hugged. They left the maze together and went back to their clean, white house. And Lily knew that if she ever got lost again, her mom and dad would always call her and help her find her way back.
