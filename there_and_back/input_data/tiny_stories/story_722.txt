Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved strawberries. She would eat them every day. One day, her mom was very tired. She did not have time to pick strawberries for Sue.
Sue had an idea. She took a big paper and a red pen. She started to print strawberries on the paper. She made lots of red strawberries. Sue showed the paper to her mom. Her mom smiled and felt happy.
Sue learned that when you help others, it makes them happy. She knew that her mom was tired, so she found a way to help. Sue felt good about helping her mom. The moral of the story is: when you help others, you feel good too.
