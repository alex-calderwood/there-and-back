Once upon a time there was a mummy and a daddy. They had a little boy called Dave. One day Dave and mummy went to the shop to get a new plate.
Mummy: What sort of plate do you want, Dave?
Dave: I want one that is easy.
Mummy: Ok. Let's get an easy plate.
They went to the shop and got a nice easy plate. When they got home Dave was so excited to use the new plate.
Dave: Yay! I love it!
Mummy: You can eat your dinner on it now.
Dave: Yes! I'm so happy!
They both smiled and mummy put the food on the plate. Dave was so happy to have a new plate. He knew it was going to make eating even easier.
