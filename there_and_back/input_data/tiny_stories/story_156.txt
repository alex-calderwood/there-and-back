Once upon a time, there was a big, deep box. In the box, there was a TV. The TV was very happy to be in the box, but it wanted to have a friend.
One day, a little girl named Amy found the box. She opened it and saw the TV. "Wow, a TV!" she said. Amy was happy to have a new friend. She took the TV out of the deep box and put it in her room.
Every day, Amy and the TV played together. They watched fun shows and sang songs. The TV was happy to have a friend, and Amy was happy too. They had lots of fun, and they were the best of friends.
