Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was very lucky, always getting the best of things. One day, Lucy was playing in the park when she heard a strange noise. It was her mommy calling her.
Lucy’s mommy told her it was time for her to go to the toilet. Lucy didn’t want to listen to her mommy’s instructions, so she kept playing and refused to go.
Suddenly, Lucy felt a wet sensation on her bottom. She had an accident in the park. This was not a lucky thing.
Lucy’s mommy was so disappointed. She told Lucy that when she tells her to go to the toilet, she must behave and listen. Lucy cried because she realized she had done something wrong.
From then on, Lucy listened to her mommy and always went to the toilet when asked. It was very important to behave properly and do what was right. Lucy learned a valuable lesson that day, making her even luckier than before.
