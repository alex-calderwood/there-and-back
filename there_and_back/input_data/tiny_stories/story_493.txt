One day, a big, smooth rock named Rocky was sitting in the park. Rocky liked to move and roll around. He saw a group of little rocks having a meeting. They were talking about how to move faster.
Rocky rolled over to them and said, "Hi, I am Rocky. I can move fast. Can I join your meeting?" The little rocks looked at Rocky and said, "Yes! Please teach us how to move fast like you."
Rocky showed the little rocks how to move fast by rolling down a hill. The little rocks tried it too, and they all moved faster than ever before. They were very happy and thanked Rocky for his help. From that day on, they all played together and had lots of fun in the park.
