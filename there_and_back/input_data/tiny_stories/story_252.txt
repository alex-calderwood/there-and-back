Once upon a time, there was a big, bright sun. It shone down on a little house near the beach. In the house lived a family. They were on vacation.
One day, Mom said, "Let's go to the store and get some food for our picnic." So, they all went to the store. They bought apples, bananas, and bread.
At the store, the little girl saw a pretty toy. She asked, "Mom, can I have this toy, please?" Mom smiled and said, "Yes, you can have it."
The family went back to the little house. They had a fun picnic on the beach under the bright sun. They played and laughed all day long. They loved their vacation by the sea.
