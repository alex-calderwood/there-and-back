One day, a little boy named Tim found a big red box in his room. He did not know where it came from. Tim was very excited to open the box. He called his friend, Sam, to come over and see the box too.
When Sam came, he said, "Don't open the box, Tim. It might be bad." But Tim did not listen. He ignored Sam and opened the box anyway. Inside the box, there was a big mess of toys and clothes. They were all mixed up and dirty.
Tim and Sam started to fight. They were mad at each other. While they were fighting, a big wind came and blew all the toys and clothes away. Now, Tim and Sam had nothing to play with. They were very sad and still mad at each other.
