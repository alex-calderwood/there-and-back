Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. He had an unusual toy car. It was big, red, and shiny. Tim loved to play with his car on the floor. He would push it and watch it pass by.
One day, Tim's friend, Sue, came over to play. She saw the unusual toy car on the floor. "Wow, what a fun car!" she said. "Can I play with it too?" Tim smiled and said, "Yes, let's play together!"
They took turns making the car pass on the floor. They laughed as the car went fast and slow. Tim and Sue had a great time playing with the unusual toy car. And from that day on, they became best friends who loved to play together.
