One day, a little boy named Tim saw a sack. The sack was big and full. Tim wanted to see what was inside the sack.
He asked his mom, "Can I open the sack today?" His mom said, "Yes, but be careful." Tim was happy and opened the sack. Inside, he found a lot of toys that were available for him to play with.
But then, something unexpected happened. The toys started to talk and play with Tim! They all had fun and played together. The toys were magic, and they became Tim's new friends.
