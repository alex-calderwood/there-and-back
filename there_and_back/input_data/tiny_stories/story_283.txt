Once upon a time, there was a gifted dog named Max. Max could do yoga. Every day, Max would gather his friends to do yoga with him. His friends liked it a lot. Max was very happy to teach them.
One day, Max and his friends went to a big park to do yoga. They were all having a good time. But then, something unexpected happened. A big wind came and blew all their yoga mats away. Max and his friends were very sad.
But Max had an idea. He told his friends to use their paws to hold on to the ground. They tried it and it worked! Max and his friends could still do yoga without their mats. They were all happy again. From that day on, Max and his friends knew they could do yoga anywhere, even when something unexpected happened.
