Jim was an eager three year old who was excited for the festival. Every year he and his family celebrated the special day with a big party. This year was going to be even better.
Jim was so curious to see what was in store that he ran down stairs to the kitchen. He heard his dad and mom talking about something special they were going to reveal at the festival.
Jim couldn't wait and he asked loudly, "What are you talking about?" His parents avoided the question, but he was not going to give up. He pestered his parents until they finally revealed that they bought Jim a puppy!
Jim got so excited that he leaped in joy and hugged his parents. But, as Jim looked closer, he realized the puppy was sick. His eagerness turned to sadness and his parents revealed that the puppy could not be saved.
Jim was devastated. At the festival, he sadly said goodbye to the puppy and his parents tried to console him. Jim was very sad, but his parents promised him he could get another puppy soon.
