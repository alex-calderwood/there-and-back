Once upon a time, there was a big crane. The crane lived in a distant land. The crane had many friends. One day, the crane saw a little mouse. The mouse was sad.
The crane asked the mouse, "Why are you sad?" The mouse said, "I cannot find my home. My home is far away." The crane wanted to help the mouse. The crane said, "I can take you to your home."
The crane put the mouse on its back. They flew close to the ground. They saw many things. They saw trees and flowers. They saw a big river. They saw a tall mountain. The mouse was happy.
At last, they found the mouse's home. The mouse said, "Thank you, crane. You are a good friend." The crane was happy too. They said goodbye and the crane flew away. The mouse was not sad anymore.
