Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was not feeling good. He had a terrible cold. His nose was red, and he sneezed a lot. Tim wanted to go outside and play, but his mom said, "No, you need to rest."
Tim was sad, but he listened to his mom. He went to his room and sat on his bed. Tim looked at the wall and saw a small toy car. He wanted to play with it, but it was too high to reach. Tim had an idea. He would use a chair to get closer to the wall.
Tim held the chair and moved it near the wall. He climbed up and got the toy car. He was very happy. Tim played with the car all day in his room. He forgot about his terrible cold for a little while. And soon, Tim got better and could go outside to play again.
