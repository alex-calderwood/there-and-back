Once there was a little girl. She was so eager to explore the world beyond her house's door. Her mother was very protective of her. Whenever the little one walked outside, she would always say: "Stay close to me, and be careful of strangers".
One day, as the mother and daughter were walking together, the little girl noticed an open pathway leading away from the mother's path. She asked her mother if she could explore it. Her mother hesitated and eventually allowed her to explore, as long as the little girl stayed within the sight of her mother.
The little girl followed the pathway, walking towards its end. Suddenly, she came across a stranger. She froze and began to worry. The stranger grinned. He said, "Don't worry, I won't harm you". The little girl's courage took over and she opened her mouth, ready to talk to the stranger. Suddenly, the mother's voice echoed: "Come to me now!". This was the moment the little girl understood why her mother was so careful with strangers. She thanked the stranger and ran back to her mother.
