Once upon a time there was a helpful animal. He liked to help everyone around him. All the other animals enjoyed having him around.
One day, the animal was walking along a path when he saw a little girl sitting by herself. She looked sad. The animal knew he had to help her. He went over to the little girl and said hello.
The little girl smiled. She told the animal her name was Sarah and she was feeling lonely. The animal told Sarah that he was happy to be her friend.
Sarah was so happy to have the helpful animal around. She enjoyed going on walks with him and playing hide and seek. She even found a burrow for them to live in together.
The animal and Sarah were best friends forever. They both enjoyed their days, playing and exploring in the sunshine.
