Once upon a time there was a little girl named Jane. Jane was very smart and enjoyed playing with her toys. One day, her uncle visited her house. Jane was very excited to see him, but her uncle frowned when he saw her toys scattered all over her room.
"What's wrong, Uncle?" Jane asked.
"Nothing, sweetheart," her uncle replied. "It's just that pulling out all those toys can be a bit tricky. It looks like you are an intelligent girl."
Jane smiled, knowing that her uncle had something special in mind.
That night, Jane and her uncle stayed up late playing a special game. Jane was fascinated by the game, as it was filled with so many fun and exciting surprises. At the end of the game, Jane looked up at her uncle with a huge smile on her face.
He had known all along how intelligent she was and wanted to give her a special treat. Jane was very happy and grateful to her uncle and the two of them hugged tightly.
