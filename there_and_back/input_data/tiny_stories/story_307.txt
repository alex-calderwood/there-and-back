Once upon a time, there was a big red barn. Inside the barn, it was very clean. Many animals lived in the barn. There were cows, pigs, and chickens. They all played together and had fun.
One day, a little apple fell from a tree near the barn. The apple was on the ground for many days. It started to rot. The animals saw the apple and did not want to eat it. They knew it was not good to eat.
The farmer saw the apple too. He picked it up and threw it away. He wanted to keep the barn and the animals clean and safe. The animals were happy and thanked the farmer. They all lived happily in the clean barn.
