Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. She had a big, old teddy bear named Mr. Bear. They liked to play together. One sunny day, Sue had an idea. "Let's make a picnic, Mr. Bear!" she said.
Sue and Mr. Bear went to the yard. They put a soft, red blanket on the grass. Sue got some bread, cheese, and juice from the house. Mr. Bear sat on the blanket and waited.
At the picnic, Sue said, "Here, Mr. Bear, have some bread and cheese." She gave him a little piece of each. They both drank juice and laughed. They had a fun time at their picnic. Sue hugged her old friend, Mr. Bear, and said, "I love you, Mr. Bear. Let's have a picnic again soon."
