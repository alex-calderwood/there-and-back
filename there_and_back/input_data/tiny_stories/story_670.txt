Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved to play with her mommy's makeup. One day, she found a big box of makeup in her mommy's room. Lily was so happy! She wanted to count all the makeup in the box. She started counting: "One, two, three..."
As Lily was counting, she started to feel dizzy. The makeup box was so big, and there were so many things to count! Lily sat down and took a deep breath. She didn't want to feel dizzy anymore.
Lily's mommy came into the room and saw Lily with the makeup. She told Lily that it's not good to play with makeup without asking. Lily felt sad, but she knew her mommy was right. She put the makeup back in the box and promised to ask next time. Lily learned that it's important to ask before using someone else's things.
