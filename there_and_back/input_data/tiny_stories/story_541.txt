One day, two friends, Bob and Sally, were walking through the park. Suddenly, Bob stopped and said, "I have a wonderful idea!" He said that he wanted to give a fashion show. Sally thought it was a foolish idea, but Bob was very excited.
Sally asked him, "What kind of fashion will you show?"
Bob answered, "We can show all sorts of clothes, including hats and shoes!"
Sally shook her head and said, "That sounds foolish to me. We don't know anything about fashion!"
Bob replied, "That's okay, we can make it up as we go along. It'll be fun!"
Sally thought about it and finally said, "Okay, let's do it!" 
So, they spent the afternoon in the park, putting on different clothes and having a fashion show. Bob and Sally had a lot of fun, and were relieved that their foolish idea had worked out in the end.
