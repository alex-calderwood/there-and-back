Once upon a time, there was a little dog named Max. Max was deaf, but he had a big goal. He wanted to play with the other dogs in the park. Max would watch the dogs from his home and decide that today was the day to make friends.
One day, Max saw a big ball in the park. He knew that if he got the ball, the other dogs would want to play with him. Max ran to the park and got the ball. The other dogs saw Max with the ball and ran to him. Max was so happy.
But then, a big dog took the ball away from Max. Max felt sad and decided to get the ball back. He followed the big dog and waited for the right time. When the big dog dropped the ball, Max grabbed it and ran back to the other dogs. They all played together, and Max had reached his goal.
