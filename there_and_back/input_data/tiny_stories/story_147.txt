Once upon a time, there were two friends called Joe and Melina. They were both very friendly, and always had lots of fun together.
One day, Joe and Melina were playing in the garden. Joe wanted to build a robot, so he asked Melina that they needed batteries to make the robot move. Melina agreed, so they went to look for batteries.
The two friends searched everywhere, but they couldn't find any batteries. Joe got very sad. Melina tried to cheer him up and said they should go and look in the shed.
Joe nodded, and they ran to the shed. When they reached the shed, Joe was very excited and he started looking for the batteries.
Suddenly, Melina shouted out: "I found it!" Joe looked over and saw that Melina had found an old battery. They both started to cheer and Joe said: "Let's try it in my robot!"
Joe put the battery in the robot, and started to hope that it worked. He prayed that the robot would move. The robot started to move and Joe and Melina were very happy. They hugged and Joe said: "We did it!" 
From that day on, Joe and Melina were the best of friends. Even if they had some disagreements, they always tried to be friendly. They hoped that their friendship would last forever.
