Once upon a time, there was a prince. The prince lived in a big castle. He was upset because he wanted to go outside and play, but he was not allowed.
One day, the prince thought of a plan to escape. He put on a hat and a coat, so no one would know who he was. He walked out of the castle and into the woods.
In the woods, the prince met a big, friendly dog. They played together all day. The dog was very good at hiding and the prince could not find him. But then, the dog came out with a ball. The prince was so happy and surprised. The dog was a magic dog! The prince and the magic dog became best friends and they played together every day.
