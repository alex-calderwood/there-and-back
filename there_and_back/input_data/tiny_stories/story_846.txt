Lily loved to dance. She danced in the morning, she danced in the afternoon, she danced at night. She danced with her dolls, she danced with her dog, she danced with her mom and dad. She danced when she was happy, she danced when she was sad, she danced when she was bored.
One day, Lily went to visit her aunt and uncle on their farm. They had a big stable with many horses. Lily liked the horses. They were big and soft and gentle. She wanted to dance with them. She asked her aunt if she could go to the stable and see the horses.
"Sure, you can go, but be careful," her aunt said. "The horses are nice, but they are also strong and fast. Don't go too close to them, and don't make loud noises. They might get scared and hurt you."
Lily nodded and ran to the stable. She saw a brown horse, a black horse, a white horse, and a spotted horse. They were eating hay and drinking water. Lily smiled and waved at them. She started to dance. She twirled and jumped and clapped her hands. She sang a song.
The horses looked at her. They were curious. They liked her song. They came closer to her. They sniffed her and nuzzled her. Lily giggled and petted them. She felt happy. She danced some more.
But then, she made a mistake. She danced too close to the black horse. She stepped on his tail. The black horse felt pain. He was angry. He kicked his leg. He hit Lily. Lily fell down. She felt pain. She cried.
The aunt and uncle heard her cry. They ran to the stable. They saw Lily on the ground. They saw the black horse. They were scared. They picked up Lily and hugged her. They checked her for injuries.
"Lily, are you okay?" her aunt asked. "Did the horse hurt you?"
Lily nodded. She had a bruise on her arm and a cut on her leg. She was bleeding. She was sad. She stopped crying.
"I'm sorry, auntie," she said. "I wanted to dance with the horses. I didn't mean to make the black horse mad. I love the horses. But they don't love me."
Her aunt kissed her and wiped her tears. She bandaged her wound. She smiled at her.
"Lily, the horses do love you. They are just animals. They don't understand dancing. They don't mean to hurt you. They were just surprised. You have to be careful around them. You have to respect them. You have to give them space. Then they will be your friends."
Lily nodded. She understood. She felt better. She looked at the horses. They looked at her. They were calm. They were sorry. They whinnied softly.
Lily smiled and waved at them. She said sorry too. She thanked them for being nice. She said goodbye. She walked with her aunt and uncle to the house. She decided to dance later. She decided to dance with her dog. He liked dancing. He was fun. He was safe. He was her best friend.
