One day, a little boy named Tim went on a tour with his mom. Tim was fearful because he had never been on a tour before. His mom said, "Don't be scared, Tim. It will be fun!"
While they were on the tour, they saw many animals. Tim was still a bit fearful, but he liked the animals. Then, they had to take a boat to see more animals. Tim was scared of the boat, but his mom said, "It's okay, just hold my hand."
On the boat, they saw a big fish jump out of the water. Tim was surprised and not scared anymore. He laughed and said, "Wow, that was fun!" His mom smiled and said, "See, trying new things can be fun!"
The moral of the story is that even if you are fearful, trying new things can be a lot of fun.
