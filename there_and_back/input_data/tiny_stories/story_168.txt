Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. Lucy liked to play with her toys, but her room was not tidy. Her mom always told her to clean up, but Lucy did not listen.
One day, Lucy wanted to dress up for a party. She looked for her favorite dress, but could not find it. She looked under her bed, behind the door, and even on the chair. But the dress was not there. Lucy was sad and did not know what to do.
Her mom came into the room and saw the mess. She told Lucy that if she kept her room tidy, she would always find her things. Lucy listened to her mom and started to clean up. She found her dress under a pile of toys. She was so happy! From that day on, Lucy always kept her room tidy. She learned that being tidy helps you find your things easily.
