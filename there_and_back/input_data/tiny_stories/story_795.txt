Once upon a time, there was a grumpy cat named Tom. He lived in a small house with his best friend, a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to read the newspaper every day. Tom liked to sit next to her and watch.
One day, Sue got a big box in the mail. She was very excited to unpack it. Tom was curious too. He wanted to see what was inside. As Sue opened the box, Tom jumped in and started to play with the newspaper that was inside. He loved the crinkly sound it made.
Sue laughed as Tom played with the newspaper. She took out a new toy from the box. It was a soft, colorful ball. Tom saw the ball and stopped playing with the newspaper. He wasn't grumpy anymore. Sue threw the ball, and Tom chased it. They played together all day and had lots of fun.
