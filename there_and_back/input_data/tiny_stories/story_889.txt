One day, a little boy named Tim went for a walk with his mom. They went up a big hill. Tim saw a box at the top of the hill. He was very excited.
"What is in the box, mom?" Tim asked. His mom smiled and said, "Let's open it and reveal what is inside." They opened the box and found many toys. The toys were organized in a neat way. There were cars, dolls, and balls.
Tim and his mom played with the toys on the hill. They had so much fun. They took the box home and put it in Tim's room. Now, Tim had new toys to play with every day.
