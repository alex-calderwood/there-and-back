One day, a sad dog named Max saw a big van. Max wanted to enter the van, but it was not open. Max sat down and said, "I wish I could go inside."
A nice girl named Lucy heard Max. She said, "I can help you, Max!" Lucy found a key and opened the van. Max was so happy, he wagged his tail. They both entered the van.
Inside the van, they found lots of toys and treats. Max and Lucy played and ate. Then, a big cat named Tom came out from a box. Max and Tom became friends, and they all played together. The sad dog was now a happy dog.
