Once upon a time, in a small house, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim loved to drink milk. His mom always told him, "Milk makes you healthy and strong."
One day, Tim saw a big glass of milk on the table. He wanted to drink it, but his mom said, "Wait, Tim! That milk is for your baby sister. I will get you your own glass of milk." Tim tried to resist, but he really wanted the milk.
Tim's mom came back with another glass of milk just for him. He drank it all up and felt very happy. His mom said, "Good job, Tim! You are growing up to be a healthy boy."
From that day on, Tim always remembered to resist taking things that were not his. He knew that sharing and being kind made everyone happy. And he kept drinking milk to stay healthy and strong.
