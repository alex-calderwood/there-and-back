One day, a little boy named Tim went to play outside. He found a deep hole in his yard. Tim saw a rope next to the hole. He wanted to see what was inside the hole, so he used the rope to lift a big rock that was covering it. When he lifted the rock, he found a toy box inside the hole.
Tim was very happy to find the toy box. He played with the toys all day. But when it was time to go inside, he put the toys back in the box and used the rope to lift the rock back on top of the hole. He didn't want anyone else to find his secret toy box.
The next day, Tim went outside to play with the toys again. He used the rope to lift the rock off the hole. But when he looked inside, the toy box was gone! Tim was sad, but then he saw his dad with the toy box. His dad had found the box and was going to give it to Tim as a surprise. Tim and his dad played with the toys together and had lots of fun.
