Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia had a small, red ball that she loved to play with. One day, while playing, her ball went over the fence. Mia was very sad.
Mia's friend, Tom, saw her looking sad. He asked her what was wrong. Mia told him that her ball went over the fence. Tom wanted to make Mia feel better, so he gave her a big hug.
Together, Mia and Tom asked for help to get the ball back. A tall man helped them get the ball from the other side of the fence. Mia was so happy to have her ball back. She hugged Tom and they played together all day.
