Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a sock that he loved a lot. But one day, the sock got very dirty. Tim was sad because he did not want his favorite sock to be dirty. 
Tim went to his mommy and said, "Mommy, my sock is dirty. Can you help me?" His mommy smiled and said, "Of course, Tim. Let's wash the sock together." They went to the washing machine and put the dirty sock in with some soap.
After the sock was washed, Tim and his mommy took it out of the washing machine. The sock was not dirty anymore! Tim was so happy to receive his clean sock back. He said, "Thank you, mommy!" And they both hugged each other. From that day on, Tim always made sure his favorite sock stayed clean.
