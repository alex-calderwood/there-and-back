Once upon a time, there was a little pony. The pony lived in a big field with many other ponies. The pony was not happy because his color was dull. The other ponies had pretty colors, but he was not like them.
One day, a little girl came to the field. She saw the dull pony and thought he was special. She walked up to the pony and said, "Let's dance!" The pony was surprised, but he wanted to try. So, they started to dance together.
As they danced, the pony started to feel happy. He didn't care about his dull color anymore. The little girl and the pony danced and laughed all day. From that day on, the dull pony knew that he was special too.
