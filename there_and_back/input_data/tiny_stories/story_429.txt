One day, on a lazy Sunday, a little cat named Tom went for a walk. The sun was shining bright and the birds were singing. Tom loved to walk in the park near his home.
As Tom walked, he saw a big dog named Max. Max was running very fast and did not stop. Tom was scared and climbed up a tree. The tree was very tall and Tom felt safe.
Max saw Tom in the tree and wanted to play. So, Max stopped running and sat under the tree. Tom saw that Max was not scary, so he came down from the tree. They played together all day and became best friends.
