Once upon a time, there was a mommy and a baby. Mommy was in the kitchen, cleaning it up. "Uh oh," she said, looking around. "You must have been unruly today, my little one!"
The baby smiled and said, "I remember!"
Mommy smiled at the baby and said, "Good. Let's keep the kitchen clean, okay?"
The baby nodded and said, "Yes!"
Mommy and the baby worked together to make the kitchen clean. When they were all done, they smiled and hugged.
"That was fun," said Mommy.
The baby grinned and said, "I remember."
