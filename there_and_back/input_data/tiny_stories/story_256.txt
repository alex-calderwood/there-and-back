One day, a girl named Lily wanted to buy a crab. She went to the store with her mom. Lily was very happy to get her new pet. She named the crab Mr. Crabby.
At home, Lily saw that Mr. Crabby was troubled. He did not want to play. Lily was sad. She wanted to help Mr. Crabby feel better.
Lily's mom had an idea. She put Mr. Crabby in a big bowl of water. Suddenly, Mr. Crabby was happy! He was not a crab, but a fish! Lily laughed and played with her new fish friend.
