Once upon a time, there was a playful cat named Mint. Mint loved to play with her ball all day. She would run and jump and have lots of fun.
One day, Mint's ball rolled away and left her. She looked everywhere for her ball, but she could not find it. Mint was very sad and missed her ball so much.
Then, a kind boy found the ball and brought it back to Mint. She was so happy to have her ball again. Mint and the boy played together all day long. They became best friends and never left each other again.
