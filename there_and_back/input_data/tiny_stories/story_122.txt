One day, a little boy named Tim went to the park. He saw a big tree with a squirrel on it. The squirrel was drinking water from a small cup. Tim wanted to touch the squirrel.
"Hi, squirrel! Can I touch you?" Tim asked. The squirrel looked at Tim and said, "Yes, but you have to be gentle."
Tim was very happy. He touched the squirrel softly. The squirrel felt soft and warm. Tim and the squirrel became friends. They played together in the park.
After they played, Tim and the squirrel were thirsty. They both drank water from the small cup. The water was cold and made them feel healthy. They were happy and had a fun day at the park.
