Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to play pretend. One day, she found a big building called a theater. The theater was a place where people acted and played pretend, just like Sue. She wanted to belong to the theater and be a part of the fun.
Sue found a serious man who worked at the theater. The serious man told Sue that she was too little to play pretend on the big stage. Sue was sad, but she did not give up. She wanted to show the serious man that she could belong in the theater too.
Sue tried to play pretend on the big stage when the serious man was not looking. She wanted to show him that she could do it. But Sue was too little, and she fell off the stage. She got hurt and cried. The serious man found her and told her that she could not belong in the theater. Sue went home, sad that she could not play pretend in the big theater.
