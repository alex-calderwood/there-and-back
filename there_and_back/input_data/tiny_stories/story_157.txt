Ben and Mia were twins who liked to play with their toys. They had many toys, but they wanted more. They saw a big pile of junk in the street and thought they could find some new toys there. They ran to the junk and started to dig.
They found a broken car, a ripped doll, a rusty bike and a dirty ball. They were happy and put them in a bag. They did not see the sign that said "Danger! Do not touch!" They did not hear the man who shouted "Hey, kids, get away from there!"
The junk was not just junk. It was part of a machine that the man was fixing. The machine had wires and sparks and made loud noises. The man was gifted and knew how to make the machine work. But he did not mention that the machine could explode.
Ben and Mia took the bag of junk and ran back to their home. They wanted to show their mom and dad their new toys. They did not know that the junk had a bomb inside. They did not know that the bomb was ticking.
They opened the door and said "Look, mom and dad, we found some new toys!" They did not see the flash and the fire. They did not hear the boom and the scream. They did not feel the pain and the end.
