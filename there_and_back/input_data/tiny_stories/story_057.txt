One day, a boy named Tim went to the store with his mom. At the store, Tim saw a big bell. He wanted to ring the bell. His mom said, "No, Tim. We need to buy oil for the car."
Tim was sad but he listened to his mom. They bought the oil and went home. On the way home, they saw a man with a bike. The man's bike was not working. Tim's mom stopped the car and asked, "Do you need help?"
The man said, "Yes, my bike needs oil." Tim's mom gave the man the oil they bought. The man was happy and said, "Thank you!" Tim felt proud that they could help the man.
When they got home, Tim's mom had a surprise for him. She took him to the backyard and there was a small bell for him. Tim was so happy! He rang the bell and felt proud that he helped the man and listened to his mom.
