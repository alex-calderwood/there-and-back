Anna liked to study. She liked to look at books and learn new things. She had a purple mug that she used to drink water or milk when she studied. She put her mug on the table next to her books.
One day, Anna's brother Ben came into her room. He saw the purple mug and wanted to play with it. He took the mug and ran away. Anna was angry. She shouted, "Ben, give me back my mug! That is my mug for studying!"
Ben did not listen. He ran to the living room and threw the mug on the sofa. The mug bounced and fell on the floor. It broke into pieces. Ben was scared. He heard Anna coming. He hid behind the curtains.
Anna saw the broken mug on the floor. She was very sad. She loved her purple mug. She cried, "Who broke my mug? Who did this?"
Ben heard Anna crying. He felt sorry. He came out from behind the curtains. He said, "I broke your mug, Anna. I am sorry. I wanted to play with it. I did not mean to break it."
Anna looked at Ben. She was still angry, but she saw that he was sorry. She said, "Ben, you should not take my things without asking. You should be careful with other people's things. You made me very sad."
Ben nodded. He said, "I know, Anna. I am sorry. I will not do it again. Can I help you clean up the mess?"
Anna smiled. She said, "Yes, you can. Thank you, Ben. Maybe we can study together later. I can show you my books."
Ben smiled back. He said, "Okay, Anna. That sounds fun. I am sorry about your mug. Maybe we can find you a new one. A purple one."
Anna hugged Ben. She said, "That would be nice, Ben. I love you, brother."
Ben hugged Anna back. He said, "I love you, sister."
