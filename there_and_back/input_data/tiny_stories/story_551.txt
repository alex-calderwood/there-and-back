Once upon a time, there was a little ball that loved to bounce. It would bounce all day and all night. It was a noisy ball, but it was also very happy. One day, the ball bounced into a big room full of food. There were apples, bananas, and cookies. The ball was so excited!
As the ball bounced around the food, it noticed a big, round cake. It wanted to bounce on top of the cake, but it was too high. So, the ball bounced harder and harder, trying to reach the top. Suddenly, the ball bounced so high that it hit the ceiling and fell back down. It landed on the cake with a big, noisy crash!
But the cake didn't break. Instead, it started to bounce too! The ball was so surprised. The cake and the ball bounced together, laughing and having fun. They became best friends, and they shared the food with all the other toys in the room. From that day on, the ball and the cake would always bounce together, making everyone around them happy.
