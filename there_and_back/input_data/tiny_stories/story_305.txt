Once upon a time, there was a small red ball. The ball was very stubborn. It did not like to stay in one place. One day, the ball saw a big ladder. The ladder was tall and strong. The ball wanted to pass the ladder.
The ball tried to pass the ladder by rolling under it. But the ladder was too low. The ball tried to pass the ladder by jumping over it. But the ball could not jump high enough. The ball was sad.
Then, a friendly bird came to help. The bird picked up the stubborn ball with its beak. The bird flew over the ladder with the ball. The ball was happy. It had passed the ladder with the help of a new friend. They played together all day long.
