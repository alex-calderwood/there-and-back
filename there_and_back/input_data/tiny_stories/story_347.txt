Tom and Lily are playing in the garden. They observe the flowers, the birds and the bugs. They like to learn new things.
"Look, Lily, this is a thermometer. It tells us how hot or cold it is," Tom says, holding a red and silver stick.
"How does it work?" Lily asks, curious.
Tom points to the red line inside the stick. "See, the line goes up when it is hot and down when it is cold. Today it is very hot, so the line is high."
Lily nods. She touches the stick and feels it is warm. "Can we use it for other things?"
Tom thinks for a moment. He has an idea. "Let's go to the pond and see how cold the water is."
They run to the pond, where they see some friendly ducks. They say hello to the ducks and ask them if they can borrow some water. The ducks quack and nod.
Tom dips the thermometer in the water and waits. The red line goes down. "The water is cold, Lily. See, the line is low."
Lily dips her finger in the water and shivers. "Brrr, you are right, Tom. The water is cold. But the ducks like it."
They thank the ducks and give them some bread. They observe the ducks eat and swim. They are happy. They learned something new today.
