Once upon a time, in a distant land, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim had a big sneeze. One day, Tim went for a walk with his mom. They walked and walked until they found a big tree.
Tim's mom said, "Let's go left, Tim!" So they went left and found a big hill. Tim and his mom climbed up the hill. When they got to the top, Tim had to sneeze. "Achoo!" he sneezed very loud.
All the birds in the distant trees heard Tim's sneeze and flew away. Tim and his mom laughed and laughed. They had a fun day, and Tim's big sneeze made it even more fun.
