Jack's mom was very busy with a task. She had lots of work to do around the house and she felt very anxious. Jack noticed his mom was unhappy and he ran to her with a hug. 
"Mommy, why are you so worried? Can I help?" asked Jack. 
Jack's mom smiled and touched his cheeks.
"Mommy can't do this task on her own," she sighed. "But I know you can help me. Let's make this a team job!"
Jack was excited and eager to help. He smiled and started to touch the items in the task. But the task was very big and he became a bit anxious. He looked up to his mom who was still busy. 
"Mommy, I'm so anxious," he said.
Jack's mom smiled and said, "Don't worry! You can do this! Just take it one step at a time, sweetheart. I promise I'll be here with you all the way."
Jack felt his worries melt away and he went back to his task. With mommy's help, Jack completed the task and felt very proud of himself. He knew this was a job he could do with his mom.
