Once upon a time, there was a nice parrot named Polly. Polly lived in a big tree with her friends. They liked to play and talk all day long.
One day, Polly found a sharp stick on the ground. She picked it up and showed it to her friends. "Look what I found!" said Polly. Her friends looked at the stick and were very excited.
Polly and her friends decided to use the sharp stick to draw pictures in the dirt. They took turns and had lots of fun. At the end of the day, they all said, "Thank you, Polly, for finding the sharp stick. We had a great time!"
