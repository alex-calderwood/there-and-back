Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. She had a red mitten that she loved very much. One day, she lost her mitten while playing outside.
Mia started to search for her mitten. She looked under a big tree, near the flowers, and by the swing. Mia felt sad because she could not find her mitten.
Then, her friend, Tom, came to help her. They searched together, and soon, they found the little red mitten under a small rock. Mia was so happy and thanked Tom for helping her. They both played together, and Mia took good care of her mitten from that day on.
