Once there was a little girl called Clara. Clara liked to play outside, but today it was raining. All of a sudden, the rain stopped and the sun came out. Clara was so excited. She grabbed her bucket and ran outside.
She ran to the muddy puddle and stepped inside it. She was covered in mud and she loved it. As she splashed around, she heard a loud noise. She looked up and saw a big dark cloud. Suddenly the cloud made a loud thunder and the wind started to blow.
Clara was scared. She was so scared that she couldn't move. Suddenly everything around her froze. Everything got quiet. She heard another noise and saw an animal hopping away.
Clara was so relieved that she wasn't alone. She suddenly felt brave and started to play in the mud again. She heard a voice from behind her. It was her mum. "Come inside, Clara. It's too scary outside."
Clara felt safe as she ran inside. She was happy to be back home.
