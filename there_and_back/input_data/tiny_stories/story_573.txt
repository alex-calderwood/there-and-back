Once upon a time, in a brilliant green yard, there was a little bee named Bob. Bob loved to fly around, visiting pretty flowers. He would buzz from one flower to another, saying hello to his friends, the ants and the ladybugs.
One sunny day, as Bob the bee was flying, he saw a big red ball. It was so big and round! Bob wanted to play with the ball, so he buzzed closer. He pushed the ball with his tiny legs, and it began to roll. Bob was so happy!
Bob the bee and his new friend, the big red ball, played all day long. They rolled and flew around the yard, laughing and having fun. As the sun went down, Bob said goodbye to the ball and went back to his hive, tired but happy from his brilliant day.
