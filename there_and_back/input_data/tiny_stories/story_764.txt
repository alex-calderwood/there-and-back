One day, Tom went to the store with his mom. He saw a toy he wanted to buy for his friend's birthday. Tom asked his mom if he could buy the toy. His mom looked at the price and said it was okay. Tom was very happy.
Tom took the toy home and wrapped it in his favorite paper. He put a big ribbon on it too. He gave the gift to his friend at the birthday party. His friend loved the gift and thanked Tom. Tom felt very happy that he could make his friend smile.
