One day, the sun was shining bright in the sky. A little girl named Lily went outside to play. She saw a big puddle on the ground from last night's rain. Lily loved puddles and wanted to jump in it.
Lily ran fast and jumped high. She landed hard in the puddle. The water splashed all around her. Lily laughed and jumped in the puddle again and again. She had so much fun playing in the water.
As the sun continued to shine, the puddle started to dry up. Lily felt sad that her puddle was gone. But she knew that the next time it rained, there would be a new puddle for her to jump in.
