Once upon a time, there was a happy boy named Tim. Tim loved to design cars. One day, he made a plan for a big race with his friends.
During the race, Tim and his friend Sam were running fast. Tim said, "I am going to win!" But then, something unexpected happened. A big dog joined the race and ran even faster than Tim and Sam!
The dog won the race, and Tim and Sam were surprised. They laughed and said, "Wow, that dog is fast!" Even though Tim didn't win, he was still happy because he had fun with his friends and the dog.
