Sara was a big girl who went to school every day. She liked to learn new things and play with her friends. But sometimes she felt tired and cranky, and she did not want to do her work or share her toys. Her teacher said she needed to take a nap, but Sara said no. She thought naps were for babies, and she was not a baby.
One day, Sara was very rude to her friend Tom. She took his crayon and broke it in half. She said it was her crayon, and he was ignorant. Tom was sad and angry. He told the teacher what Sara did. The teacher was not happy. She said Sara had to say sorry to Tom, and then go to the nap room. Sara did not want to go. She cried and kicked and screamed.
But the teacher was firm. She took Sara to the nap room, where there were soft mats and blankets. She told Sara to lie down and close her eyes. Sara did not listen. She stayed awake and made noises. She hoped the teacher would let her go back to the class. But the teacher did not. She said Sara had to stay in the nap room until the end of the week. Sara was shocked. She did not like the nap room. She missed her friends and her work. She realized she had made a big mistake. She wished she had taken a nap when the teacher asked her. She wished she had been nice to Tom. She wished she had not been ignorant. She learned a hard lesson. She decided to be a better girl from now on.
