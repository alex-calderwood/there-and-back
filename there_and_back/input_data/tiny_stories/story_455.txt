Tommy was a brave three year old. He had an adventurous spirit, but today he was feeling a little frightened. He was alone in his room and he didn't know why. He took a deep breath and peered out of his window. He saw something very strange. 
A big and scary monster was outside, watching Tommy's house. Tommy was frightened and stepped back, wanting to hide. But before he could do anything, the monster spoke. 
“Don’t worry," it said. "I won’t hurt you." Tommy cautiously looked around the corner and heard the monster again. "I want to give you a special word," the monster said. "It's the word 'courage'. You can use this word whenever you feel scared. Keep it with you". 
Tommy smiled. He was no longer frightened. He waved goodbye to the monster and vowed to use the word whenever he felt scared.
