Once upon a time, a pale boy named Tim went to visit his friend, Sue. Sue lived in a small house near a big tree. Tim liked to play with Sue because she was fun and they laughed a lot.
One day, they found a big box in Sue's yard. They wanted to test what was inside. Tim said, "Let's open it!" Sue was scared, but she said, "Okay, let's do it." They opened the box, and a big wind came out. It blew them away and they could not play anymore.
Tim and Sue were very sad. They tried to find their way back home, but they could not. They were lost and could not play together again. The end.
