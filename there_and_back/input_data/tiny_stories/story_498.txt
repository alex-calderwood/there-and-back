Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a lawyer named Tom. He was very good at his job, but he was unknown to most people. Tom wanted to help others, so he went to the town center to meet new friends.
One day, he met a boy named Tim. Tim was sad because he lost his toy. Tom wanted to help Tim find his toy. They looked high and low, near and far. Finally, they found the toy close to a big tree. Tim was so happy, and they became good friends.
Now, Tom the lawyer was not unknown anymore. He helped many people in the town and made lots of friends. Everyone loved Tom, and he was happy to be a helpful friend to all.
