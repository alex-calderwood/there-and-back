Once upon a time, there was a wise grandmother who lived in a big house. Her family always asked for her advice because she had a big opinion. One day, her granddaughter Lucy came to visit.
Lucy was a very curious child and wanted to explore the big house. She tried to open the door to a bedroom, but it wouldn't fit.
“Grandma, why won’t the door fit?” asked Lucy.
“That’s a very good question, my dear,” the wise grandmother said. “You must be careful and fit the right key into the lock to open the door.”
Lucy looked at the keyhole closely and tried a few different keys until she found the right one. It fit perfectly! The door finally opened and Lucy excitedly explored the room. 
The wise grandmother smiled. She was happy that Lucy had used her opinion to find the right key.
