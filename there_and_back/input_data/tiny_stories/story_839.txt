Once upon a time there was girl who loved to explore. One day she found herself walking in a big field and she wondered what would be around the next corner. She walked and walked until she reached a tall tree. She looked up and saw a big cone and wondered what it was. 
She was brave and decided to climb the tree. She climbed and climbed until she reached the cone. As soon as she touched it she felt uncomfortable. She looked around and saw that the cone had a lot of fuzzy things all around it. 
The girl guessed that the cone was a big nest. She wondered who could live in it and looked around. Suddenly there was a lot of noise and a big bird jumped out of the nest. 
The girl gasped and felt a bit scared, but soon realized that the bird was friendly. She smiled and waved goodbye to the bird. She felt glad that she could explore and discover new things.
