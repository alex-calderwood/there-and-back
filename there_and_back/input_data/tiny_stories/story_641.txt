One day, a boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a big cloud in the sky. The cloud was full of rain. Tim was not happy. He did not want to get wet. He saw a girl named Sue. Sue was organized. She had an umbrella.
"Hi Sue!" said Tim. "Can I walk with you? You have an umbrella. It will keep us dry from the rain."
"Sure, Tim! We can walk together," said Sue. They walked and talked. They were happy.
But then, something unexpected happened. A big wind came. It blew Sue's umbrella away. Now, they were both wet from the rain. Tim and Sue were sad. They went home. The day was not good.
