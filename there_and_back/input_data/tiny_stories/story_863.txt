Once upon a time, in a deep, deep wood, there lived a big, scary bear. The bear had a big, comfy armchair in his cave. He loved to sit in his armchair and take long naps.
One day, a little girl named Lily went into the deep wood. She saw the bear's cave and went inside. She saw the big armchair and thought, "I want to sit in that armchair. It looks so comfy." So, Lily sat in the bear's armchair.
The big, scary bear came home and saw Lily in his armchair. He said, "Who is in my armchair?" Lily was scared. She said, "I am sorry, Mr. Bear. I just wanted to sit in your comfy armchair." The bear was very mad. He scared Lily away and she ran back home.
Lily never went into the deep wood again. She learned not to take things that were not hers. And the bear, he kept his armchair all to himself, making sure no one tried to sit in it again.
The moral of the story is: do not take things that do not belong to you.
