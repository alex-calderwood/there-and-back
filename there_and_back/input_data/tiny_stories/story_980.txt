Once upon a time, there was a big red car. The car had four round wheels. One day, the car went to the park. It was a sunny day.
At the park, the car met a small blue car. The blue car said, "Do you want to play?" The red car said, "Yes, let's play!" They played all day, but the red car felt that one of its wheels was dull.
Suddenly, the dull wheel broke! The red car was sad. Then, the blue car had an idea. It said, "I can release my wheel and give it to you!" The red car was happy.
The blue car released its wheel and gave it to the red car. Now, the red car could play again. The two cars played and had fun all day. They were now best friends.
