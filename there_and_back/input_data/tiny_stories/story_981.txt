Lily and Max were playing with a ball in the yard. They liked to throw the ball to each other and catch it. Sometimes they missed and the ball rolled away. They ran after it and laughed.
One time, the ball went too far and hit the porch. The porch was where Grandma sat and read her book. The ball made a loud noise and Grandma looked up. She was angry. She did not like the ball hitting her porch.
"Hey, you two!" she shouted. "Stop throwing the ball at my porch! You will break something!"
Lily and Max stopped and looked at Grandma. They were scared. They did not want to make Grandma angry. They said sorry.
"Sorry, Grandma," they said. "We did not mean to hit your porch. We were just playing."
Grandma sighed. She was not really angry. She loved Lily and Max. She just wanted them to be careful.
"It's okay, my dears," she said. "But please play somewhere else. The porch is not a good place for a ball. Why don't you go to the park? There is more space there and you can have more fun."
Lily and Max nodded. They liked the park. They picked up their ball and ran to the gate. They waved to Grandma and said thank you.
"Thank you, Grandma," they said. "We will go to the park and play. We love you."
Grandma smiled and waved back. She watched them go and then went back to her book. She was happy. She loved Lily and Max.
