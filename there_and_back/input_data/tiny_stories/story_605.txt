Sara and Tom were going on a trip with Mom and Dad. They had to pack their luggage with clothes and toys. Sara was very excited. She wanted to see new places and have fun. Tom was not so happy. He did not like to travel. He wanted to stay home with his friends.
"Tom, why are you so sad?" Sara asked him. "We are going on a trip. It will be fun."
"I don't want to go on a trip. I want to stay here. I don't like new places. They are scary and boring." Tom said.
"But Tom, you can imagine anything you want. You can pretend you are a pirate or a superhero or a dinosaur. You can make up stories and play games. You can have fun anywhere." Sara said.
"No, I can't. I can only have fun here. I don't want to imagine. I want to be real." Tom said.
Sara tried to cheer him up, but Tom was stubborn. He did not listen to her. He did not pack his luggage. He did not say goodbye to his friends. He did not smile or talk to anyone.
They got in the car and drove to the airport. It was a long drive. Sara looked out the window and saw many things. She saw trees and flowers and animals and buildings and people. She imagined stories about them. She was happy. Tom looked at his feet and did not see anything. He did not imagine anything. He was sad.
They got to the airport and checked in their luggage. Sara was amazed by the big planes and the loud noises and the many people. She imagined she was a pilot or a spy or a princess. She was curious. Tom was scared by the big planes and the loud noises and the many people. He imagined he was lost or trapped or alone. He was nervous.
They boarded the plane and found their seats. Sara was thrilled by the window and the clouds and the sky. She imagined she was flying or exploring or dreaming. She was adventurous. Tom was terrified by the window and the clouds and the sky. He imagined he was falling or crashing or dying. He was panicky.
The plane took off and flew high. Sara was happy. Tom was sad. The plane hit some turbulence and shook. Sara was excited. Tom was scared. The plane had a problem and started to smoke. Sara was surprised. Tom was horrified. The plane had to make an emergency landing. Sara was hopeful. Tom was hopeless.
The plane landed hard and broke. Sara was alive. Tom was dead.
