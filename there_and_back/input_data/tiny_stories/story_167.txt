Once upon a time, there was a mild iron. The iron liked to follow its friends. One day, the iron saw a nice bird. It decided to follow the bird. The iron followed the bird across the meadow, through the trees, and over the river. 
The iron and the bird got to a big hill. The iron was getting tired, but it kept following the bird. Finally, they reached the top of the hill. The bird flew away and the iron looked around. It was happy to see all the pretty flowers and butterflies.
The iron sat down and had a rest. It saw a caterpillar and decided to follow it. This caterpillar was heading further up the hill. The iron followed until it reached the top of the hill. The caterpillar disappeared and the iron looked around. 
The iron was at the highest point of the hill and could see far away into the distance. It was so happy. The mild iron enjoyed the view from the top of the hill and decided to stay there for a while.
