Once upon a time, there was a humble cat named Tom. Tom loved to play all day with his ball. One day, while playing, Tom found a note on the ground. The note had a big heart on it. Tom was very excited to find the note.
Tom showed the note to his friend, a dog named Max. Max said, "Wow, Tom! That note is special. Let's see what it says." They opened the note and it said, "I love you, Tom." Tom and Max were very surprised.
Just then, a little girl named Lily came running over. She said, "Tom, I wrote that note for you! I wanted to tell you how much I love you!" Tom was so happy that he jumped and played with Lily and Max all day long. And they all became the best of friends.
