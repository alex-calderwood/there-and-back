One day, a big dog and a little cat were in the park. The big dog wanted to be cooler because it was a hot day. The little cat was not hot. The big dog saw a rough rock and thought it would be cooler to sit on it.
The big dog went to the rough rock and tried to sit on it. But the little cat got there first. The big dog was sad. He wanted to be cooler too. The little cat saw the big dog was sad and had an idea.
The little cat moved over and made room for the big dog on the rough rock. The big dog sat down next to the little cat. Now, they both could be cooler on the rough rock. They were happy and became friends.
