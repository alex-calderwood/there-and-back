Tim was a pupil at a big school. He liked to learn new things and play with his friends. He was very bright and knew many words and numbers.
One day, Tim was thirsty after running in the yard. He saw a bottle on a table in the hall. He thought it was water and he wanted to drink it. He did not see the label that said "Do not drink. Poison."
He took the bottle and drank some of the liquid. It tasted bad and made him feel sick. He dropped the bottle and ran to the teacher. He told her what he did and she was very scared.
She called for help and took Tim to the nurse. The nurse gave him some medicine and tried to make him better. But it was too late. The poison was too strong and Tim could not breathe. He closed his eyes and did not wake up.
The teacher and the nurse were very sad. They cried and hugged each other. They wished they could save Tim. They wondered who left the bottle there and why. They missed Tim very much. He was a good pupil and a bright boy.
