One day, a little girl named Lily went to the store with her mom. They wanted to buy some grapes. Lily saw a big bunch of grapes and said, "Mom, can we get these? They look interesting!"
Mom looked at the grapes and said, "Yes, we can get these grapes. They look yummy!" Lily was very happy.
As they were going to pay, a friendly dog came running into the store. The dog saw the grapes and wanted some too. The dog urged Lily, "Can I have some grapes, please?"
Lily was surprised and said, "Dogs can't eat grapes! They can make you sick." The dog didn't know that. He was sad, but he thanked Lily for telling him. Lily gave the dog a treat instead, and they all went home happy.
