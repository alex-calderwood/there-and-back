Tom likes math. He likes to count and add and take away. He has a math book with many pictures and numbers. He always wears his math book in his backpack when he goes to school.
One day, Tom is very sad. His math book is broken. The pages are torn and the cover is ripped. He does not know how it happened. He thinks maybe a dog or a cat or a big wind did it. He does not want to go to school without his math book.
He tells his mom about his broken math book. His mom is very kind. She hugs him and says, "Don't worry, Tom. I have a surprise for you." She takes him to the car and drives to a big store. The store has many books and toys and games. She says, "You can choose a new math book, Tom. Any math book you like."
Tom is very happy. He looks at all the math books. He sees one with many colors and shapes and puzzles. He likes it very much. He says, "I want this one, mom. Thank you, mom." His mom smiles and says, "You're welcome, Tom. I'm proud of you for loving math."
Tom wears his new math book in his backpack. He goes to school with a big smile. He shows his new math book to his teacher and his friends. They all say, "Wow, Tom. What a nice math book. Can we see it?" Tom says, "Yes, you can. We can do math together." He opens his math book and starts to count and add and take away. He is very happy. He loves math.
