Once upon a time, there was a famous toy named Bob. Bob was a robot. He could talk and play with kids. He was a happy robot. Bob had a battery inside him. The battery made Bob go.
One day, Bob was talking with a girl named Sue. They were having fun. But suddenly, Bob stopped talking. Sue was sad. She did not know what to do. She thought Bob did not want to play anymore.
Sue's dad saw her sad face. He knew what to do. He took out the old battery and put in a new battery. Bob started to talk again. Sue was so happy. They played all day. Sue learned that when things stop working, you can fix them. And she knew that she should always ask for help when she needed it.
