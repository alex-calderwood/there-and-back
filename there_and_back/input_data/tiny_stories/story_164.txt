Once upon a time, there was a little girl. She was always very adventurous and curious. One day she wanted to do something fun. She decided to explore the house. 
As she was walking, she noticed a ball of yarn in the corner. She picked it up and began playing with it. Suddenly a voice said, "Hey! That's my yarn!" It was her big sister. 
The little girl had never seen her sister so angry. She watched as her sister reached out and grabbed the yarn from her. "I told you not to touch my things! That was very naughty of you!" 
The little girl was sad. She had just been trying to have a little bit of fun. But she was too scared to tell her sister that. 
So instead, she just looked down and apologized. Her sister softened and said, "You can borrow my things, as long as you ask first. Be more adventurous, and observe your surroundings first, okay?" 
The little girl nodded, took her sister's hand and said thank you. From then on, she was more careful to observe before she touched anything.
