Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play at the park. Her favorite thing to do was to swing on the swings.
One sunny day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a new ladder on the play set. It was an original ladder, not like the others. Lily climbed up the ladder to the top. She felt so happy and proud.
After climbing the ladder, Lily went to the swings. She sat on a swing and her mom pushed her. Lily swung higher and higher, laughing and having fun. She played all day until it was time to go home. Lily couldn't wait to come back and play again.
