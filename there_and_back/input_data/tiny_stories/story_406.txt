Once upon a time there was a light octopus living in the sea. He wanted to explore the world above the ocean but he was a bit scared. He asked some of his friends for advice and they told him, "Don't be scared, just try it! Nothing bad can ever happen if you stay close to the water." 
The octopus was excited but he was still worried about the unknown. He decided to take the plunge and he jumped out of the water.
At first, he found that being out of the water was quite thrilling and he went off exploring the new world. As he continued to explore, he suddenly felt a chill. He was beginning to freeze and he knew he had to get back to the water as quickly as he could!
He started swimming back as fast as he could but suddenly he remembered the advice his friends had given him, "Stay close to the water". He realized that if he had stayed close to the water, he wouldn't have been so far away and the chill wouldn't have been so intense. 
The octopus was very glad to be back in his warm ocean home safe and sound. He learned an important lesson that day, that it's always best to stay close to what's familiar.
