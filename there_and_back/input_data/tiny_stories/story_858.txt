Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Daisy. Daisy was only three years old, but she was brave and strong. 
That day, Daisy decided to take her red rake outside and do some gardening. It was cold outside - too cold for Daisy by herself. So, she asked her mom if she could take her brother, Peter, with her. Her mom said yes, and soon Daisy and Peter were out in the garden together. 
Daisy and Peter raked the leaves together. They piled them up into a big stack and Daisy hoped that it would get even bigger. But then, it started to get dark, so Daisy and her brother started to head back home. 
"It was so cold, but we had fun, right Pete?" said Daisy.
"Yeah," said Pete, smiling. 
Daisy and Peter laughed, holding hands as they walked back home. Daisy hoped they could do it again soon.
