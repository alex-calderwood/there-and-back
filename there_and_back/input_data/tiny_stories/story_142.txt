Once upon a time, there was a happy little dog named Spot. Spot loved to run and play in his yard. His yard had a big fence around it to keep him safe. Spot liked to chase butterflies and roll in the grass.
One day, Spot saw a little bird outside the fence. The bird said, "Hi, Spot! Do you remember me? We played together last summer." Spot wagged his tail and said, "Yes, I remember you, Birdie! I had so much fun playing with you."
Birdie asked, "Can you come play with me today?" Spot looked at the fence and said, "I can't go over the fence, but we can play here." So, Birdie flew into the yard and they played together all day long. They were both very happy.
