"The Terrible Frame"
Once, there was a framed painting that was so terrible that it frightened everyone who looked at it. One day, a 3-year-old child asked what was wrong with the painting. His parents said, "It's suffering. Can you help us out by trying to make it better?"
The child smiled and said, "Sure!" He then grabbed some crayons and drew colourful flowers and animals around the painting.
Within minutes, the painting looked so much better. Everyone was so proud of the 3-year-old's effort.
The child proudly exclaimed, "I made it better!" 
The parents replied, "Yes, you did! Now nobody will suffer any more when they look at the frame." They all cheered and hugged the 3-year-old, thankful that the terrible frame was no more.
