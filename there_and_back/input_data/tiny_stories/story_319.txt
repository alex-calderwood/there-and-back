Mary was a girl who was three years old. One day, her father gave her a gift. It was a toy that was hairy. Mary liked it very much. She laughed because it felt funny. She was excited to play with it.
She brought it to the kitchen and showed it to her mom. Mom liked it too. She said it looked funny. Mary hugged it and smiled. She was happy to have a new toy.
Mary and her mom went to the park. She played with her new toy there. She put it in the grass and watched it move around. She laughed because it was funny.
In the evening, Mary put her new hairy toy in her room. She hugged it and said good night. She was glad to have a new gift.
