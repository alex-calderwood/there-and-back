Once upon a time, there was a hero named Tim. Tim had a big, expensive cape. One day, Tim went to the park to play.
While playing, Tim saw a little girl crying. She had lost her toy. Tim said, "Don't worry, I will find your toy." Tim looked all around the park. He found the toy under a tree.
Tim returned the toy to the girl. She smiled and said, "Thank you, hero!" Tim felt happy. He went home and told his mom all about his day.
