One day, Tim made a plan. He wanted to ride his bicycle to the park. He thought it would be fun. So, he put on his hat and went outside.
At the park, Tim saw his friends. They were playing and having fun. Tim wanted to play too. He thought about his selfish ways. Then, Tim let his friends ride his bicycle. They all had fun together. Tim was happy he shared his bicycle.
