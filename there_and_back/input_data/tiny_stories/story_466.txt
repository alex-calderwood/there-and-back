Once upon a time, there was a small boy named Tim. Tim lived near a big mountain. One day, he wanted to polish his shoes. Tim said to his mom, "Mom, I want to polish my shoes."
Mom said, "Okay, Tim. You can polish your shoes, but be careful."
Tim went outside to polish his shoes. He saw a small door in the big mountain. Tim was very surprised. He opened the door and went inside.
Inside the mountain, Tim found a small room. In the room, there was a big bear. The bear said, "Hi, Tim. I can help you polish your shoes."
Tim was happy. The bear helped Tim polish his shoes. They became good friends. From that day on, Tim and the bear had many fun times together.
