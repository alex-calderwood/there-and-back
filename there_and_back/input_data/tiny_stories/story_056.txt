Sara and Ben were playing in Sara's room. They liked to dress up in the clothes from the big wardrobe. Sara put on a red dress and a hat. Ben put on a blue shirt and a tie. They pretended to be grown-ups.
"Hello, sir. You look very nice today," Sara said.
"Thank you, madam. You look very pretty too," Ben said.
They smiled at each other and held hands. They wanted to kiss, like they saw their parents do. They leaned closer and closer.
But then, something jumped out of the wardrobe. It was a big, furry monster with sharp teeth and claws. It roared and growled. It was angry and hungry.
Sara and Ben screamed and let go of each other. They tried to run away, but the monster was faster. It grabbed them both and dragged them into the wardrobe. It slammed the door behind it.
Sara and Ben never came out again. The monster ate them up.
