One day, a little octopus was hidden under a rock. He liked to gaze at the fish that swam by. The fish did not know the octopus was there. They laughed and played, and the octopus wished he could play too.
The octopus decided to come out and play with the fish. He was shy, but he wanted to make friends. As he came out, the fish stopped and looked at him. They had never seen an octopus before.
The fish were scared at first, but then they saw that the octopus was nice. They started to play together, and they had so much fun. The octopus was happy he came out from under the rock. Now, he had many friends to gaze at and play with.
