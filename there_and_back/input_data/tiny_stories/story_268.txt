One day, a boy named Tim found a boring, old pot in his yard. He wanted to destroy it, but his mom said, "No, Tim. We can use this pot to grow a pretty flower."
Tim was sad but listened to his mom. They put dirt and a seed in the pot. They watered it every day.
A few days later, a big, green plant grew. Tim was happy. But one day, the plant started to shake. Tim and his mom watched as the boring, old pot broke into pieces. A magic, talking flower came out! The flower said, "Thank you for growing me. I will give you one wish."
Tim and his mom were very surprised. They wished for a new, pretty pot for the magic flower. They all lived happily, and the boring, old pot was not so boring after all.
