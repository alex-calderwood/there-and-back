Once upon a time, there was a kind and generous girl named Lily. She had a pretty sweater that she loved to wear. The sweater was red and kept her warm.
One day, Lily saw a little boy who was cold. She wanted to help him, so she gave him her sweater. The little boy was very happy and everyone around them started to applaud. They clapped their hands because Lily was so generous.
But then, it started to get very cold outside. Lily didn't have her sweater anymore, and she felt very cold too. She tried to find a warm place, but she could not. In the end, Lily was very sad and cold because she gave away her sweater.
