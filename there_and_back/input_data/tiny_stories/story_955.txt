Once upon a time, there was a graceful lady. She had a pretty purse with her. One day, she went for a walk in the park.
In the park, she met a nice dog. The dog was very friendly. The lady wanted to give the dog a treat. She opened her purse to reveal a yummy treat inside.
The dog was very happy. It wagged its tail and ate the treat. The lady and the dog became good friends. They played together in the park every day. And they lived happily ever after.
