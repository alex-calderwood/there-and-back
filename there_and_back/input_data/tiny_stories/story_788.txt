Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia loved to play with her friends. One day, Mia and her friends had a quiz. The quiz was to find the most original thing they could think of.
Mia thought and thought. She looked around and saw a big tree. "I know!" she said. "I will draw a tree with rainbow leaves!" Her friends liked her idea, and they all drew trees with rainbow leaves.
After they finished, Mia said, "Thank you for playing the quiz with me!" Her friends said, "Thank you, too!" They all learned that it is nice to thank others and that being original is fun.
