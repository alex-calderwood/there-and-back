One day, a fireman went to the store to buy a black hat. He liked the hat because it matched his uniform. The fireman wore the hat every day to work.
At work, the fireman saw a cat stuck in a tree. He said, "Don't worry, cat. I will help you." The fireman climbed the tree and saved the cat. The cat's owner was so happy and said, "Thank you, fireman!"
The moral of the story is to always help others when they need it. The fireman was a good friend to the cat and its owner. Everyone was happy because they helped each other.
