Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tim. Tim lived in a small nest on a big tree. One day, Tim saw a crack in the tree. He was scared that his home might fall.
Tim had an idea. He found some fake leaves and mud. He used the mud to fill the crack in the tree. Tim put the fake leaves on top to make it look nice. He was very happy with his work.
Later, it rained very hard. The rain soaked the mud and fake leaves. The water made the mud soft and the crack was fixed. Tim felt safe in his nest again. He was glad that he could fix the tree and keep his home safe.
