Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was excited because he was going to the doctor today. He had an operation to fix his hurt leg. Tim's mom held his hand as they walked to the doctor's office.
When they got to the doctor's office, Tim saw a big chair. The doctor told him to sit down. Tim felt a little scared and started to frown. His mom told him not to worry, the operation would make his leg all better.
After the operation, Tim's leg felt much better. He was excited to play with his friends again. His mom gave him a big hug and they went home. Tim's frown turned into a big smile.
