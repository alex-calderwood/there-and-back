Once upon a time, there was a big wake. All the animals came to play. They were happy. The sun was shining, and the trees were green. The birds sang songs, and the bees buzzed around.
A nice bear named Ben had a job. He had to supply the food for the wake. He brought honey, fruits, and nuts. But, he was scared of a dangerous snake named Sam. Sam liked to scare the other animals.
At the wake, all the animals were eating and playing. But then, Sam the dangerous snake came. The animals were scared. Ben the bear was scared too. But, something unexpected happened. Sam the snake did not want to scare the animals. He wanted to help Ben supply the food. Sam brought more fruits and nuts for the animals to eat.
The animals were happy and surprised. They learned that Sam was not dangerous after all. Sam and Ben became good friends. The wake was a big success, and all the animals had fun together.
