Once upon a time, a little girl named Lily found an original toy in her room. It was a small, green dragon with a big scale on its back. Lily loved her new toy and played with it all day.
One hot day, Lily took her dragon toy outside to play. She met her friend, Tim, who had an ice cream. "I wish my dragon could eat ice cream too," said Lily. Tim laughed and said, "But your dragon is just a toy, it can't eat ice cream!"
Later, they left their toys in the sun and went to play hide and seek. When they came back, they saw that the ice cream had started to melt. The sun was very hot, and the dragon's big scale had also started to melt! Lily and Tim were surprised. They learned that even toys can change in the sun. They promised to take better care of their toys and always keep them safe.
