Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia was a dependable friend. She always helped her friends when they needed her. One day, a new girl arrived at her school. Her name was Lily.
Lily was sad because she did not know anyone. Mia saw her and said, "Hi, I'm Mia. Do you want to play with me?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, thank you!" They played together all day and became good friends.
One day, Mia and Lily found a magic book. The book had a spell in it. Mia said, "Let's try the spell!" They said the spell together, and a big, fun toy appeared. Mia and Lily played with the toy and had lots of fun. They were very happy and always stayed friends.
