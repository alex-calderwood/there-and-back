Once upon a time, there was a big rainbow in the sky. A little boy named Tom saw the rainbow and wanted to mark it on his paper. He got his crayons and started to draw.
"Be careful, Tom," said his mom. "Don't break your crayons." Tom was careful and drew the rainbow with all its colors. He was so happy with his drawing.
Just then, something unexpected happened. The rainbow jumped out of the paper and into the room! Tom and his mom were very surprised. They laughed and played with the rainbow. It was a magical day they would always remember.
