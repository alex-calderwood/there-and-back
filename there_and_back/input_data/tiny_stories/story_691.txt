One day, a kangaroo named Kiki was hopping in the forest. Kiki was very soft and loved to play with her friends. She saw her friend, the rabbit, lying on the grass.
"Hi, rabbit!" said Kiki. "Why do you lie on the grass?"
Rabbit looked up and smiled. "I like to lie here because it is soft and cool," he said. "Come, lie with me, Kiki!"
Kiki hopped over and lay down next to rabbit. They both felt the soft grass under them. They talked and laughed as they looked at the sky. They saw big, white clouds that looked like animals.
Soon, more friends came to join them. A squirrel, a bird, and a deer all lay down on the soft grass too. They all enjoyed the warm sun and the soft grass together. They played games and told stories until it was time to go home.
At the end of the day, Kiki said goodbye to her friends and hopped back to her cozy home. She was happy she had spent the day with her friends, lying on the soft grass and having fun.
