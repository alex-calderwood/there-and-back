Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a boy named Tim. Tim loved to eat sausages. One day, his mom made a new kind of sausage. It was not the original sausage Tim liked. It was different.
Tim saw the sausage and had a question. He asked his mom, "What is this?" His mom said, "It is a new sausage. Try it, you might like it." Tim was not sure, but he wanted to try.
He took a bite of the new sausage. It was good! Tim liked the new sausage too. He was happy that he tried it. Now, Tim liked both the original and the new sausage. And they all lived happily ever after.
