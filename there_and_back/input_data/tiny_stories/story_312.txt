Once upon a time, there was an elderly lady named Grandma Sue. She loved to watch cartoons with her little grandchild, Timmy. Every day, they would sit on the soft couch and watch their favorite cartoon together.
One day, while they were watching the cartoon, they heard a strange sound. "What was that?" asked Timmy. Grandma Sue listened carefully and said, "I don't know, Timmy. Let's go see."
They walked to the window and saw a big, funny bird outside. The bird was making the strange sound they heard. Timmy laughed and said, "Look, Grandma! The bird is singing like the cartoon!"
Grandma Sue smiled and said, "Yes, it is, Timmy! What a funny bird!" They both laughed and went back to watch more cartoons, happy to have found the source of the strange sound.
