Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to change her clothes and try new styles. She had many pretty dresses and shoes in her room.
One day, Sue was feeling impatient. She wanted to wear a new style to play with her friends. She looked at her dresses and shoes and thought about what to wear.
Sue picked a red dress and blue shoes. She changed into her new style and went outside to play. Her friends liked her new style too. They all played together and had a fun day.
