Once upon a time there was a boy called Tom. He was very curious and always wanted to explore new places. One day, he found a mysterious box that he wanted to open. He tried to open it from all sides, but he could not find an opening. He then thought of an amazing idea; he asked his mom for a key and she gave him one. Tom was so excited, he put the key in the box and then unlocked it.
He saw inside the box many wonderful things. He opened them one by one and was so happy to find a secret harbor. He saw boats, ships and lots of exciting places and animals. It was an amazing sight. For hours, Tom and his friends explored the harbor and had a lot of fun. The sun was setting and they were all very happy.
