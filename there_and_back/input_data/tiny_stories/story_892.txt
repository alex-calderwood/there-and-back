Once upon a time, there was a big, noisy dog named Spot. Spot loved to play with his ball and his jar. One day, Spot was playing with his jar in the yard. He would step on it and watch it roll away. Spot was very happy.
As Spot was playing, he saw a little cat named Fluffy. Fluffy was scared of the noisy dog. Spot wanted to be friends with Fluffy, so he took a step back and showed her his jar. Fluffy saw the jar and thought it was fun.
Spot and Fluffy started to play with the jar together. They would step on it and watch it roll. They laughed and played all day. The noisy dog and the little cat became best friends. From that day on, Spot and Fluffy always played with the jar and had a lot of fun.
