Once upon a time, there was a little chicken named Dizzy. Dizzy was not like other chickens. She would spin and spin until she felt very dizzy. All the other chickens would laugh and play, but Dizzy just loved to spin.
One day, Dizzy wanted to show her friends how fast she could spin. She gathered all her friends in the yard and started to spin. Round and round she went, faster and faster. Her friends watched in amazement as Dizzy spun like a top.
Finally, Dizzy stopped spinning and fell to the ground. She was so dizzy that she couldn't stand up straight. All her friends laughed and clapped. They had never seen a chicken spin so fast before. From that day on, Dizzy was the most famous spinning chicken in the whole yard.
