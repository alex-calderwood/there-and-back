One day, a big, heavy octopus named Otto was swimming in the sea. He felt tired and wanted to lay down. He saw a nice, soft rock and swam over to it.
As Otto lay down on the rock, he met a small fish named Fin. Fin said, "Hi, Otto! Why are you laying on this rock?" Otto replied, "I am tired and this rock is soft."
Fin and Otto became friends. They played and swam together in the sea. Otto did not feel tired anymore. They were both happy and had lots of fun.
