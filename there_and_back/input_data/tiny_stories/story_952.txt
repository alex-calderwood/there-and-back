Once there was a young boy called Dave. He was very rich so he had lots of toys. One day, he decided to go for a walk.
As he was walking he saw a tip. It was full of nice things, like toys and sweets. He wanted to remove some of the things in the tip, so he started taking them.
Suddenly a voice said, "Hey! What are you doing?"
Dave was very scared. He turned around and saw a policeman. He said, "I was only taking some of the things from the tip."
The policeman said, "That is against the law. It is stealing. You must go to jail now."
Dave was very sad. He had to go to jail and he lost his toys. It was a bad ending to his day.
