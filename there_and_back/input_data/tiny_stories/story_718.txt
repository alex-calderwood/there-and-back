One day, a boy named Tim had a dog. The dog was big and enthusiastic. Tim loved to read books to his dog. They would sit under a tree and read together.
One day, Tim and his dog were reading a book about a cat. The dog was very excited to hear the story. As they read, a real cat walked by. The dog saw the cat and wanted to play.
The dog jumped up and ran after the cat. Tim tried to stop the dog, but he was too fast. The dog and the cat ran far away. Tim looked and looked, but he could not find his dog. He was very sad.
