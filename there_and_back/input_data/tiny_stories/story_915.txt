Once upon a time, a boy named Tim was playing a game of cards with his mom. He wanted to win, but his mom kept beating him.
"Mom, why are you so smart?" he asked.
"Because I didn't quit," she said with a smile.
The little boy thought about this and said "I won't quit either!"
His mom looked at him and said, "That's a good attitude. If you never quit, then you'll never get beat".
Time looked at his card and decided he could still win. He worked hard and soon he was beating his mom. She looked at him, surprised.
"Mom, I beat you! I didn't quit!" he said, proud of himself.
His mom smiled. "That's right! And it's stupid to quit when you have the chance to win."
Tim kept playing and soon he was the card champion. He was never too stubborn to quit, but he never forgot his mom's advice to always keep playing unless it was impossible to win.
