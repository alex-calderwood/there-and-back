Once there was an enormous worm called Sammy. He lived in a ditch near a house. Sammy had been lying in the dirt for days and he was really tired. One day a three year old boy named Bill saw Sammy and he thought he was really funny. Bill was so excited that he lay down right next to Sammy. Sammy was a little bit scared by the enormous Bill and decided to wiggle away and hide. Bill thought it was funny and started to laugh. Sammy was relieved that Bill was only playing and he enjoyed playing with his new friend. They spent the whole afternoon together, laughing, wiggling and lying in the dirt. By the end of the day Sammy said goodbye to Bill and hopped away. Bill waved goodbye to his new friend Sammy.
