Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a little dog named Spot. Spot loved treats. One day, Spot saw a big jar of treats on the top shelf. He wanted to get the treats, but he was too small. He thought of a plan. He would ask his friend, the cat, to help him.
Spot went to his friend, the cat, and said, "Can you help me get the treats? They are too high for me to reach." The cat agreed to help. They started to stack up boxes and chairs to reach the treats. But they didn't know that the jar was very heavy.
As they climbed higher and higher, the stack started to shake. It was a terrible idea. The cat said, "This is not safe, we should stop." But Spot didn't listen. He wanted the treats so badly. Suddenly, the stack fell down with a big crash!
Spot and the cat were not hurt, but they made a big mess. Spot's mom came in and saw what happened. She said, "You should have asked for help instead of doing something dangerous." Spot learned that it is important to ask for help and not to do things that are not safe.
From that day on, Spot always asked for help when he needed it. He never tried to do something that was too hard or dangerous by himself. And he still got to enjoy his treats, but in a safe way.
