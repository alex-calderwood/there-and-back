Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Tom. Tom was three years old. Tom liked to play all kinds of games. His favourite game was building with blocks. He would spend hours playing and creating different shapes. 
One day, Tom was playing alone in the garden. Suddenly, he heard a strange noise. He looked up in the sky and saw a very rare bird. The bird was so special and beautiful. Tom enjoyed the sight of it and watched it fly away. 
Tom wanted to share his special moment with someone, so he ran to his mother. She was very happy to hear his story. 
From then on, Tom learnt a valuable lesson. Sometimes in life we can enjoy special moments on our own, but it's always nice to share them with others. Sharing brings us much happiness.
