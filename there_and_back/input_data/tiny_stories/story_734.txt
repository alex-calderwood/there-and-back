Once upon a time there was a fat player. He was always playing and having fun. One day, he broke and he didn't know how to fix it. He was so sad and he said, "Oh no! What can I do?". 
At that moment, an old man passed by and saw him. He said, "I see you have a problem. Don't worry, I can help you fix it." 
The fat player thanked the old man and the old man fixed the player with ease. The player was so happy that he said, "Thank you! You are the best in the world!" 
The old man replied with a smile, "No problem at all. I'm glad that I could help you." 
Afterwards, the fat player was able to play again and he was very happy. The end.
