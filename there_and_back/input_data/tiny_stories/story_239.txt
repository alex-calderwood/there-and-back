Once upon a time, there was a faucet. The faucet was open, and water came out. The water made a puddle on the floor. 
One day, a frog came into the room. The frog saw the puddle and wanted to play. The frog jumped into the puddle and started to dance. The frog danced and danced, making the puddle bigger and bigger.
Then, something unexpected happened. The faucet stopped being open. The water stopped coming out. The frog was sad and stopped dancing. But then, the faucet started to dance too! The frog and the faucet danced together, and they were both happy.
