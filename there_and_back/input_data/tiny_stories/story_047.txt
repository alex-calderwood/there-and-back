Once upon a time, there was a generous zebra named Zara. She lived in a big forest with her friends. Zara loved to share her toys and food with everyone.
One sunny day, Zara and her friend, a little monkey named Momo, were playing near a big tree. They found a big, red ball. Zara and Momo both wanted to play with the ball. They could not decide who should play with it first.
Zara said, "Let's both play with the ball together!" Momo agreed, and they played with the ball all day long. They had lots of fun and were very happy. Zara and Momo learned that sharing made their day even better.
