Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Tim. Tim loved to fly high in the sky. One day, Tim felt very dizzy. He did not know why he felt this way. He tried to fly, but he could not.
Tim was sad. He wanted to fly with his friends. Tim's mom saw him on the ground. She knew that he needed help. Tim's mom told him to fold his wings and rest for a while.
Tim did what his mom said. He folded his wings and rested on the ground. After some time, Tim felt better. He was not dizzy anymore. He thanked his mom and flew high in the sky with his friends again.
