One day, Max and his mom went grocery shopping. When they got to the fish section, Max was excited to see different types of fish. He wanted to see the tuna, so his mom took one out. It was delicate and Max wanted to touch it. 
"Be careful, Max," his mom said. "This tuna is very delicate."
Max was excited. He wanted to see how much it weighed. 
"Let me see it, Mom!" he said.
So Mom took it to the scale and weighed it. "It weighs one pound!" she said.
Max smiled. He had learned something new. Tuna was delightful and delicate and it also weighed one pound.
