Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was very hot one day. He wanted to be cooler. He saw a big tree with lots of shade. Tim walked to the tree and sat down. Now, he was cooler and happy.
Tim saw his friend, Sam. Sam was frustrated. He was hot too. Tim said, "Come sit with me under the tree. It is cooler here." Sam walked to the tree and sat down with Tim. Now, Sam was cooler and not frustrated anymore.
Tim and Sam played under the tree all day. They wanted more friends to be cooler with them. They asked other kids to join them. Soon, many kids were under the tree, all cooler and happy. They all played together and had a great day.
