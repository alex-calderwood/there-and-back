Once upon a time, there was a little car who loved to go fast. This car had a lot of speed. It would zoom down the road, making all the other cars look slow. The little car felt happy when it went fast. But some of the other cars thought the little car was scary because it went so fast.
One day, the little car saw a big hill. The little car wanted to go up the hill very fast. It thought it would be fun to use its speed to go up and down the big hill. So, the little car went faster and faster, all the way up the hill.
As the little car reached the top of the hill, something unexpected happened. It saw a small and pretty butterfly. The butterfly was not scary at all. The little car wanted to be friends with the butterfly. So, the little car slowed down and followed the butterfly, not going fast anymore. The other cars were not scared of the little car now. The little car learned that it is nice to slow down sometimes and make friends. And they all lived happily ever after.
