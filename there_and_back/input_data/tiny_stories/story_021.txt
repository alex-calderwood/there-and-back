One day, a girl named Lucy wanted to cook. She asked her mom, "Can I cook with you?" Her mom said, "Yes, you can help me cook today."
While they were cooking, Lucy saw a band outside her window. The band was playing loud and fun music. Lucy wanted to play with the band too. She found a fake drum and started to play along with the band.
Lucy's mom said, "You are very good at playing the fake drum! Maybe one day, you can join a real band and cook yummy food for them too." Lucy smiled and kept playing her fake drum, dreaming about cooking and playing in a band.
