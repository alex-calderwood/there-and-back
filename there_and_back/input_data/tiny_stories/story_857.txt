Once upon a time, there were two friends living in a small, humble village. The friends were Tommy and Sally. Tommy and Sally loved playing together, but each had a different way of playing. Sally liked to play in order, while Tommy liked to play messy and all mixed up!
One day, they were building a sandcastle. Tommy got out of order, making the castle too big. Sally got mad and said he should bury it. Tommy was sad and wanted to keep the castle, but Sally insisted. So Tommy had no choice but to bury the castle.
But after Tommy started to bury it, Sally had a change of heart and wanted to keep the castle! But it was too late! Tommy was already busy burying the castle.
Sally was sad, but the two friends soon got back to the game and ended the day having fun together like always. They never forgot the day they almost buried the castle and learned to respect each other's differences!
