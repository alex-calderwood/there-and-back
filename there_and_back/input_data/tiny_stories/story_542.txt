Once upon a time, there was a little intelligent insect named Buzz. Buzz lived in a big green tree. He had many friends in the tree.
One day, Buzz saw a fire near the tree. The fire began to burn the tree. Buzz was scared. He went to his friend, Ant. "Ant, the tree is burning! We need to help our friends!" said Buzz. Ant nodded and they went to tell the others.
Together, Buzz, Ant, and their friends worked to stop the fire. They used water from a nearby pond. Finally, the fire was out. All the insects were safe. They thanked Buzz and Ant for their help. From that day on, the insects were more careful and lived happily in their big green tree.
