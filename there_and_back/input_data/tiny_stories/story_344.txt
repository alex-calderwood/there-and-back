One day, a graceful cat named Kitty went for a walk. She saw the sun high up in the sky. The sunshine was warm and bright. Kitty loved to feel the sun on her fur.
As Kitty walked, she saw a big puddle. She did not want to get wet, so she jumped over it. Just then, she heard a small voice say, "Help me, please!" Kitty looked down and saw a little fish in the puddle. The fish was sad because the puddle was not deep enough for him to swim.
Kitty thought of a plan to help the fish. She went to find her friend, Doggy. Doggy was good at digging. Kitty asked, "Doggy, can you please dig a hole for the fish?" Doggy agreed, and they went back to the puddle. Doggy dug a deep hole next to the puddle. Then, Kitty and Doggy pushed the water into the hole. The fish was so happy to have a new home!
But suddenly, the sun hid behind a big cloud. The sky turned dark, and it started to rain. Kitty and Doggy were scared, but the fish was excited. The rain filled up the hole even more, and the fish could swim freely.
When the rain stopped, the sun came out again. The sunshine dried Kitty and Doggy's fur, and they felt warm and happy. They had helped their new friend, and they were proud. The fish thanked them, and they all played together under the bright sun.
