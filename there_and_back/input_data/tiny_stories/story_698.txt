Once upon a time, there was a little bee named Buzz. Buzz lived in a hive with his family. The hive was in a big tree. Buzz was an ordinary bee, but he had a big wish. He wanted to see the world.
One day, Buzz's mom said, "Buzz, you can go out and play." Buzz was so happy. He knew this was his chance to see the world. He flew away from the hive. He saw flowers, bugs, and birds. It was amazing.
But then, Buzz saw a big net. It was coming for him! He was scared. He thought of his hive and his family. He missed them. Just then, a kind bird came and helped Buzz. The bird released the net, and Buzz was free. Buzz thanked the bird and flew back to his hive. He was happy to be home with his family. He knew that even ordinary bees could have big adventures.
