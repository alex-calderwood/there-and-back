Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Mia. Mia did not like going to the market with her mom. She would always say, "Mom, I hate the market!" Her mom would smile and say, "But Mia, we need to buy food for our home."
One sunny day, Mia and her mom went to the market. The sun was very harsh, but Mia was happy because she had her big hat. At the market, they saw a big, red ball. Mia's eyes grew wide and she asked her mom, "Can I have the ball?" Her mom said, "If you are good at the market, I will buy you the ball."
Mia was very good at the market. She helped her mom pick out fruits and vegetables. Suddenly, a big wind came and took Mia's big hat away! Mia was sad and started to cry. Then, something unexpected happened. The big, red ball flew up into the air and blocked the harsh sun. Mia stopped crying and smiled. She said, "Mom, I don't hate the market anymore!" Her mom smiled and said, "I'm glad, Mia. Now we can go home and play with your new ball."
