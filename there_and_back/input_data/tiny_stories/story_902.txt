Once upon a time, there was a nice cat named Tim. Tim had a sore leg. He loved to sort his toys by size, but he could not do it with his hurt leg. He felt sad.
One day, Tim saw a little ant. The ant was very good at sorting things too. Tim asked the ant to help him sort his toys. The ant said yes, and they became friends. They played together every day, and Tim's leg started to feel better.
Finally, the day came when Tim's leg was all better. He could sort his toys again! The ant was so happy for Tim. They sorted the toys together, and it was the best day ever. Tim was very glad he met the ant, and they stayed friends forever.
