Once upon a time, in a charming little house, there lived a girl named Lily. Lily loved to bathe and eat pears. One day, she went to the market to buy some pears.
At the market, she met a boy named Tom. Tom said, "Hi, Lily! I love pears too! Can we share?" Lily said, "Okay, Tom. Let's share the pears." So, they bought the pears and went to the park.
At the park, they sat under a tree and ate the pears. They were very happy. But then, it started to rain. Lily and Tom ran to find a place to hide. They found a small cave and went inside.
In the cave, they found a big bear. The bear was angry because they came into his home. The bear chased Lily and Tom out of the cave. They were wet, scared, and had no more pears.
