Mary was walking in the park and she saw a jeep nearby. She couldn't help herself, so she rushed over to it and started pushing it around. She thought it was so much fun!
Suddenly, a voice said to her: "You need to be more graceful when you play with my jeep!" Mary looked up and saw a girl who was smiling down at her. Mary felt embarrassed and said sorry.
The girl laughed. "It's okay, I understand it's tough not to get excited when you see such a cool jeep!" She said. They talked for a little while and then the girl looked sad.
"I regret having to tell you this, but I have to go home now." She said. Mary felt sad too, and wished she had been more graceful earlier. She smiled and said goodbye to the girl and watched her leave.
