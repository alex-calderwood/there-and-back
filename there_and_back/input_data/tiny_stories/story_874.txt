Once upon a time, there was a lively little frog named Fred. Fred lived in a small pond with his family. Fred loved to jump and play with his friends in the pond.
One day, Fred found a long stick called a spear. He showed it to his friend, a fish named Fin. Fin said, "Wow, that's a big stick! Let's play with it." So, Fred and Fin played with the spear, taking turns to push it through the water.
After a while, Fred got tired and said, "I want to quit. Let's play something else." Fin agreed and they put the spear away. They swam and played in the pond until it was time to go home. Fred and Fin had a fun day with the spear and couldn't wait to play again tomorrow.
