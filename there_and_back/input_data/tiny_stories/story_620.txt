Once upon a time, there was a unique little girl named Mia. She loved to bake yummy cakes with her mom. One day, Mia and her mom decided to go on a fun safari trip.
On the safari, Mia saw many animals. She saw big lions, tall giraffes, and fast zebras. Mia was very happy. She told her mom, "Mom, I want to bake a cake for the animals too!"
Her mom said, "That's a great idea, Mia! Let's bake a big cake when we go home." So, when they went back home, Mia and her mom baked a big cake for the animals. They put the cake in a box and took it back to the safari.
Mia and her mom gave the cake to the animals. The animals loved the yummy cake. Mia felt very happy to share her cake with her new animal friends. From that day on, Mia and her mom visited the safari often, and they always brought a tasty treat for the animals.
