Once upon a time, there was a lovely little red train. This train loved to go fast. It would burn wood to make steam. The steam would help the train go very fast. The train had a friend, a big green tree. The tree would always wave to the train when it went by.
One day, the train saw the green tree looking sad. The train wanted to help, so it thought of a plan. The train would take the tree on a fun trip. It knew that the trip would make the tree happy again.
The next day, the train came to the tree with a big surprise. The train had a new friend, a big blue truck. The train and the truck worked together to move the tree. The tree was so happy! The train, the truck, and the tree all went on a lovely trip together. And they all lived happily ever after.
