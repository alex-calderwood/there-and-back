Once upon a time there was a little girl named Laura. She was a very grateful person and she loved nice things. One day she found a beautiful ornament at the beach. It was shiny and sparkled in the sunlight. She was so thrilled that she marked it with her name so that nobody would take it away.
Every day Laura would look at her enchanted ornament. She was so proud of it. She thought it was so special and she was very grateful to have it.
One day, Laura decided to give it to her best friend as a present. Her friend was so delighted that she hugged Laura in surprise. Now they both had something to remember each other by. 
From that day on, Laura and her friend were even closer than before. They both felt grateful for their special ornament, and for their friendship.
