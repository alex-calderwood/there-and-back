Once upon a time there was a little bunny named Sarah. Sarah loved to play in the meadow near her home. One day, she hopped out of her burrow to go explore, as she always did.
But suddenly, Sarah stopped! She realized that instead of grass, the soft ground was covered with a strange, soft, dark material. It was velvet!
Sarah was afraid--she had never seen velvet like this before. She started to panic! She was in a deep and dark place. Sarah knew she had to get out quickly, but she felt worried and alone.
The bunny tried to hop, but the velvet was so thick and thick that she couldn't move very fast. Sarah got scared, so she took a deep breath and closed her eyes. Then, little by little, Sarah slowly hopped forward.
Finally, after a while, Sarah made it to the edge of the velvet. She was safe in the bright meadow once more. Sarah learned her lesson that day---to never panic in a strange place.
