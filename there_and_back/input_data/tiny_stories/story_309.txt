Once upon a time, there was a lonely bell. It was all alone in a big field and rang out a beautiful sound in the morning and evening. 
One day, a small girl walking in the field heard the sound of the bell. She ran up to it, clapped her hands and asked, "What are you doing here?" 
The bell replied, "I have been here for years, but no one is here to hear me. I remain in this field all alone".
The small girl was sad to hear that the bell was so lonely. She smiled and said, "Do not worry, I will stay here with you." She sang songs and listened to the bell's lovely ringing. 
The two were happy together and the bell remained in the field, never feeling lonely again.
