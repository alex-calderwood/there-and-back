Once upon a time, a little girl named Gina lived with her mother in a big city. One day, when Gina was playing with her toys, a magical tower suddenly appeared in the middle of the room! Gina was so surprised, that she didn't know what to do!
Gina: "Mama, look! What's this tower?"
Mama: "It's an unknown tower, my dear. Maybe somebody has given it to us as a present!"
Gina: "Wow! I love it! Can I play with it?"
Mama: "Yes, of course. It's here for you to enjoy. Have fun!" 
Gina spent the whole day playing with the tower and enjoying its magical powers. Every day, Gina and her mama would get other presents from an unknown giver. They were always surprised and happy with each new gift!
