One day, a girl named Lucy was helping her mom in the kitchen. They were putting dirty plates into the dishwasher. Lucy's mom was very patient and showed Lucy how to do it.
"Mom, why do we have to put the plates in the dishwasher?" Lucy asked. Her mom said, "So they can get clean, silly! Then we can use them again."
Just then, something unexpected happened. The dishwasher started to talk! It said, "I don't want to clean the plates anymore!" The dishwasher was complaining! Lucy and her mom looked at each other, surprised.
Lucy's mom said, "Why are you complaining, dishwasher?" The dishwasher said, "I want to go outside and play, too!" Lucy and her mom laughed. They told the dishwasher that it could go play after it cleaned the plates.
The dishwasher agreed, and it cleaned the plates very fast. Then, Lucy, her mom, and the dishwasher went outside to play. They all had a fun day together.
