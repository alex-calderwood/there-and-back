One day, a big dog and a small cat were friends. They liked to discuss things. They talked about a thief who took things from others. The thief was not nice, and they did not like him. The dog and the cat did not want the thief to take their things.
One day, the dog and the cat saw the thief. He was trying to take something from a house. The dog and the cat wanted to stop him. They had a plan. The dog would bark very loud, and the cat would scratch the thief. They thought the thief was stupid, so the plan would work.
The dog and the cat went to the thief. The dog barked very loud, and the cat was ready to scratch. But, something unexpected happened. The thief was not a real thief. It was just a man who lost his key. He was trying to get back into his house. The dog and the cat felt bad. They said sorry to the man, and they all became friends.
