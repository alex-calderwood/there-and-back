Once there was a little boy named Michael who lived on the navy ship. He had many adventures around the deep oceans. He always felt so safe and loved on the navy ship.
One day, Michael was out exploring the ship when he suddenly became very scared. He began to cry and no one was around to help him.
But then, something amazing happened. A deep, calm voice suddenly came from the darkness. It was a whale!
The whale comforted Michael and said, "Don't be scared my friend. I'm here to keep you safe." Michael felt so much better after that and he smiled.
From that day on, The whale and Michael became great friends. Michael was never scared exploring the oceans again, because he knew the whale was there with him to make him feel safe and comforted.
