Once upon a time, there were two sisters who lived in a small house. The house had a fireplace and everyday the sisters would sit in front of it and keep warm.
One day, the older sister was feeling cold and so she asked her younger sister to move aside so she could get closer to the fireplace. But her sister didn't want to. She wanted to stay near the fireplace and kept going closer and closer to it.
The older sister became very mad and said, "You are being selfish! I don't have enough room to keep warm." But the younger sister didn't care. She kept shining closer and closer to the fireplace.
The older sister became really upset and decided to do something about it. She got up and moved the fireplace away from both of them. Now, the sisters could both get close to the fireplace and keep warm!
The younger sister learned that it's good to share and everybody should get a chance to shine warm by the fireplace.
