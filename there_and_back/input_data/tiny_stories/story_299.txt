Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a wealthy man named Mr. Pepper. Mr. Pepper had a big house and many toys. He liked to play all day long.
One day, it started to rain. The rain was very heavy. Mr. Pepper wanted to play outside, but he could not. He was sad.
Then, something unexpected happened. A big rainbow appeared in the sky. Mr. Pepper followed the rainbow and found a big pot of gold. He shared the gold with everyone in the town. Now, all the people in the town were happy, and they played together every day.
