Once there was a little girl called Selina. She loved to explore. One day she saw a rope lying on the ground. She picked it up and started to swing it around and around in circles. She rushed over to her best friend, Jack.
"Look what I found!" Selina said to Jack.
Jack was very happy and he asked Selina if he could play with her. They ran to the park and started to swing the rope around and around. They were having so much fun!
Soon the sky started to get dark and they had to go home. Selina was very quiet as she was walking home. She was thinking about all the fun they had while they were playing with the rope in the park.
Every day Selina would go back to the park, and every day she would rush to get there as soon as she could. She loved playing with the rope and enjoying the peace and quiet of the park.
