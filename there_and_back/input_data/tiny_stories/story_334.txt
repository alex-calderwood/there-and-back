Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a hairy dog named Max. Max loved to play outside in the sun. One day, he saw a little mosquito flying around. The mosquito was sad because it had lost its way home.
Max wanted to help the mosquito. He thought hard about how to restore the mosquito's happiness. He had an idea! Max decided to ask his friends, the birds, to help find the mosquito's home.
The birds flew high and low, looking for the mosquito's home. Finally, they found it near a pond. The mosquito was so happy to be home again! Max felt good that he could restore the mosquito's happiness. From that day on, Max and the mosquito became the best of friends.
