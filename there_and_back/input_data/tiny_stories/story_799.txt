Once upon a time, there was a big, colorful whale. The whale liked to make big splashes in the water. He was very happy.
One day, the whale saw a boat. The boat had people on it. The people were happy. They liked to see the whale make big splashes.
But one day, the whale made a very big splash. The splash was too big. The boat with the people went up in the air and then down into the water. The people were not happy anymore. The colorful whale was sad too.
