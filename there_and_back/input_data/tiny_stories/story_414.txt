One day, Tom and his dog, Spot, went on a walk. Tom had a map to find a good park. Spot was very happy. They walked and walked. The sun was shining and the birds were singing.
Tom looked at the map and said, "We are almost there!" Spot wagged his tail. They saw a big tree and a pretty flower. They walked some more.
Finally, they found the good park. Spot stared at the other dogs playing. Tom said, "Go play, Spot!" Spot ran and played with the other dogs. Tom and Spot had a fun day at the park.
