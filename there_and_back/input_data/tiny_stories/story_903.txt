Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Bobo. Bobo loved to fly high in the sky. One day, Bobo felt very tired. His wings were not strong enough to fly anymore. So, he sat on a tree to rest.
While Bobo was resting, he saw a message on the tree. The message said, "Watch out for the sharp thing!" Bobo looked around to find the sharp thing. He saw a big, sharp branch near him. Bobo was scared and jumped away from the sharp branch.
Bobo learned to be careful and watch out for sharp things. He told all his friends about the message and the sharp branch. They all learned to be careful too. After that, Bobo and his friends played together, and they were happy. Bobo was not tired anymore, and he flew high in the sky again.
