Once upon a time, there was a big party in the forest to celebrate a little animal's birthday. All the animals came to have fun. They played games, ate yummy food, and danced to happy songs.
In the middle of the party, a serious-looking owl flew down from a tree. "What are you doing?" he asked the little animal. "We are celebrating my birthday!" said the little animal with a big smile. "Do you want to join us?"
The serious owl thought for a moment, then said, "Okay, I will join your party!" All the animals cheered and continued to celebrate. The serious owl played games, ate yummy food, and even danced with the other animals. Everyone had a great time at the little animal's birthday party.
