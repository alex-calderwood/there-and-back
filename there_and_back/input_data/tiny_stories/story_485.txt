One day, a little girl named Amy met a charming dog named Max. Max could talk! He said, "Hi, I am Max. I hate meat. I only like to eat fruit." Amy was very surprised.
Amy said, "But Max, dogs love meat. Why do you hate it?" Max said, "I don't know. I just don't like it. I like apples and bananas more." Amy thought it was strange, but she liked Max anyway.
One day, Amy and Max went to the park. They saw another dog named Buddy. Buddy said, "Hey Max, do you want to eat some meat with me?" Max said, "No, I hate meat. I only eat fruit." Buddy got mad and said, "You're a weird dog, Max." Max was sad, but Amy hugged him and said, "It's okay, Max. You're still my charming friend." Max smiled and they played together at the park.
