One day, a big red bus went down the street. The bus was very clumsy. It bumped into things as it went. The people on the bus were surprised. They looked out the window to see what was happening.
A kind girl named Sue got off the bus. She wanted to help. Sue looked at the bus very closely. She wanted to examine it. She saw that one of the wheels was not round. It was making the bus clumsy.
Sue found a man to help fix the bus. He took off the bad wheel and put on a new one. The bus was not clumsy anymore. It went down the street without bumping into things. The people on the bus were happy, and they all said "thank you" to Sue.
