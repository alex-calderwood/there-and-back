One day, a big ant wanted to move some earth. The ant was very organized. He called his ant friends to help him. They all came and started to move the earth together.
"Let's move the earth here," said the big ant to his friends. They all moved the earth and made a big pile. They were very happy with their work.
But then, something unexpected happened. A big wind came and blew the earth away! The ants were sad. The big ant said, "It's okay, friends. We can move the earth again." So, they worked together, moved the earth again, and made a new pile. This time, they put a big stone on top to keep the wind from blowing it away.
