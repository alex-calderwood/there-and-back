Once upon a time, in a big palace, there lived a king. The king was restless. He could not sleep at night. He tried many things to sleep, but nothing worked.
One day, a wise man came to the palace. He told the king to soak his feet in warm water before going to bed. The king did as the wise man said. That night, he slept very well.
The king learned that it is important to listen to good advice. He was happy and not restless anymore. The people in the palace were happy too. The moral of the story is to listen to others and try their ideas when you need help.
