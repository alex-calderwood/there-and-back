Once upon a time, there was a lonely beetle named Bob. Bob lived in a big tree. He had no friends to play with.
One sunny day, Bob saw a group of bugs playing near the tree. They were laughing and having fun. Bob wanted to join them, but he was too shy.
Then, a kind little bug saw Bob and asked, "Do you want to join us?" Bob said yes, and they all played together. Bob was not lonely anymore, and he made many new friends.
