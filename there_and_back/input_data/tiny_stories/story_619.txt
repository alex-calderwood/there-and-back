Once upon a time, in a mild, sunny town, there was a little girl named Amy. Amy loved to play with her toys and do fun things. One day, she found a new thing in her toy box. It was a small, round ball.
Amy asked her mom if she could play with the new thing. Her mom said, "Yes, I will allow you to play with the ball. But please be careful not to break anything." Amy was very happy and started to play with the ball in her room.
Amy threw the ball up and down, and rolled it on the floor. She had so much fun with her new thing. She played with it all day long. When it was time for bed, Amy put the ball back in her toy box. She knew she would have many more fun days with her new thing.
