Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a girl named Jane. Jane loved pink things. She had a pink dress, pink shoes, and a pink hat. One day, Jane wanted to eat jam. She asked her mom, "Can I have jam, please?"
Her mom said, "Yes, you can have jam, but first you must clean your room." Jane did not like to clean her room, but she wanted the jam. So, she went to her room and started to clean.
As Jane was cleaning, she found a big pink box under her bed. She opened it and saw a lot of tasty jam inside! Jane was very happy. She ran to her mom and said, "Look, I found jam in a pink box!"
Her mom was surprised and said, "Wow, I forgot about that box! It was a gift from your grandma." Jane ate the jam and did not complain about cleaning her room anymore. From that day on, Jane loved cleaning her room, because she never knew what she might find.
