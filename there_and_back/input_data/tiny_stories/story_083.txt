One day, a little dog named Spot went for a walk. He saw a big cat. The cat was fierce. Spot was scared, but he wanted to make friends.
"Hi, cat! Can I stay and play with you?" asked Spot. The cat looked at Spot and said, "Yes, but you must be nice."
Suddenly, Spot felt a sneeze coming. "Achoo!" he sneezed. The cat jumped back and laughed. "That was a big sneeze!" said the cat.
Spot and the cat played all day. They ran and jumped. They had so much fun. Spot was not scared of the fierce cat anymore. They became best friends.
