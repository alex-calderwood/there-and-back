Once upon a time, in a peaceful little town, there was a girl named Sally. Sally loved to look at things through her toy microscope. She liked to see how things looked up close.
One day, Sally found a pretty leaf outside. She wanted to look at the leaf with her microscope. But when she picked it up, she accidentally made a tear in the leaf. Sally was sad that she had torn her pretty leaf.
Sally's mom saw her feeling sad and asked what was wrong. Sally showed her mom the torn leaf and her microscope. Her mom smiled and said, "Don't worry, we can find more leaves outside." They went outside together, found more pretty leaves, and had fun looking at them with the microscope. Sally felt happy again.
