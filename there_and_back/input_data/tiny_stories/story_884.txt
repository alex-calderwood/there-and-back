Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Sue. Sue loved to walk in her pink shoes. She walked every day in the park with her mom and dad. Sue was a very organized girl. She liked to keep her toys and shoes in their right place.
One day, Sue went for a walk in the park with her mom. Sue saw a pink flower. She picked it up and gave it to her mom. Her mom smiled and said, "Thank you, Sue. This pink flower is very pretty." Sue felt happy.
After their walk, they went back home. Sue put her pink shoes in their right place. She also put the pink flower in a vase on the table. Sue was happy that everything was organized. Sue's mom and dad were proud of her. They all had a fun day together.
