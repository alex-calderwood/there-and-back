One day, a cat and a dog were playing in the sun. They were very happy. The cat was smooth and the dog was big. They liked to run and jump together.
The cat saw a big bug on the ground. The cat wanted to play with the bug. The cat tried to slap the bug with its paw. But the bug was too fast. The cat tried again and again.
The bug got mad at the cat. The bug called its friends. Many bugs came and they were not happy. The bugs chased the cat and the dog. The cat and the dog ran away. They were sad and scared. The day was not fun anymore.
