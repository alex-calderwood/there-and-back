One day, a fat cat named Tom saw a big ball. He wanted to play with the ball. So, he went to his friend, a dog named Max. Tom asked Max, "Will you pass the ball to me?" Max said, "Yes, I will pass the ball to you."
They played with the ball all day. They passed the ball back and forth. They had lots of fun. When they were tired, they sat under a tree. Tom gave Max a wink. Max winked back at Tom.
As they sat under the tree, a little bird flew by. The bird saw Tom and Max playing with the ball. The bird said, "Can I play too?" Tom and Max said, "Yes, you can play too!" So the fat cat, the dog, and the little bird played with the ball until the sun went down.
