One day, a little girl named Amy was playing in her room. She had a big, colorful curtain in her room. She loved to hide behind it and pretend she could vanish. Amy liked the curtain because it was useful for playing hide and seek.
Amy's friend, Tim, came over to play. They decided to play hide and seek. Amy said, "I will hide first, and you will find me!" Tim agreed and started to count. Amy ran to her favorite hiding spot behind the curtain. She whispered, "I will vanish here!"
Tim finished counting and started to look for Amy. He looked under the bed and in the closet, but he couldn't find her. Then he saw the curtain move a little. He walked over and pulled back the curtain. "I found you!" he said. Amy giggled and said, "You found me! Now it's your turn to hide!" They played hide and seek all day, and the curtain was very useful for hiding.
