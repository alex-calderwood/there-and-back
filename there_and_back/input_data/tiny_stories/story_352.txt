Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim. Tim was playing outside in the dirt. He found a filthy stone that was all dirty. He picked it up and started to clean it.
While Tim was cleaning the stone, he saw a small bug on it. The bug looked sad and said, "Please don't take away my home." Tim felt bad and started to cry.
Tim said, "I'm sorry, little bug. I didn't know this was your home." He put the stone back where he found it, and the bug was happy. Tim and the bug became good friends, and they played together every day.
