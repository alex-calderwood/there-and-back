One day, a boy named Tim was very excited. He was going to the park with his mom. Tim loved the park because it was big and had many different things to play with. He felt safe there, too.
At the park, Tim saw a big, round, red ball. He had never seen a ball like this before. Tim wanted to play with the ball. He pushed the ball and it rolled very fast. Tim laughed and ran after the ball.
Suddenly, the ball stopped. Tim was confused. Then, the ball started to change. It became a big, round, red dog! Tim was surprised but happy. He had a new friend to play with at the park. They played together all day and had lots of fun.
