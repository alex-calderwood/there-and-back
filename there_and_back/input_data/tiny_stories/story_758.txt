One day, a little girl named Lucy went to the park with her mom. They saw a tiny bug on the ground. Lucy wanted to pick it up, but her mom said, "No, Lucy, don't pinch the bug. It might get hurt."
Lucy looked at her mom and said, "Okay, Mom. I will be alert and not pinch the bug." They walked around the park and saw more bugs. Lucy was very careful not to pinch them.
As they walked, they saw a spark on the ground. It was a shiny rock! Lucy picked it up and showed it to her mom. Her mom said, "Wow, Lucy, that's a beautiful rock! You found a treasure!" Lucy was so happy that she didn't pinch the bug, and now she had a sparkly rock to take home.
