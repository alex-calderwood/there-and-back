Once upon a time, there was a brave dog named Spot. Spot had four legs. He liked to run and play with his friends.
One day, Spot and his friends went to the park. They played catch and had fun. Spot enjoyed running fast with his legs. He was very happy.
At the park, Spot saw a little girl who was sad. She had lost her toy. Spot wanted to help. He looked for the toy and found it under a bush. The little girl was happy, and Spot felt good for being brave and helping her.
