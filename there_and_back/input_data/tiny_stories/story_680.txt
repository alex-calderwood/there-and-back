Once upon a time, there was a big dog named Max. Max was so big that all the other dogs in the park looked up to him. Max had a job at a store. He was part of the staff. He loved to help people and make them happy.
One day, Max wanted to do something fun. He decided to spend the day at the park with his friends. Max and his friends played fetch and ran around. They were having a great time. Max was so big, he could run faster than all the other dogs.
As the sun began to set, Max and his friends were tired from their fun day. They said goodbye and went home. Max was happy he got to spend the day with his friends. He went to sleep dreaming about the next big adventure they would have together.
