Once upon a time, there was a naughty little boy named James. Every year, he loved to dance. He would spin and twirl and have so much fun.
One year, he wanted to dance all night long. He started dancing around the room and wouldn't stop. His mom asked him to stop, but he kept on dancing. He was being so naughty!
Finally, his mom said that she was going to have to punish him. He kept on dancing, still being naughty. But then, his mom snatched him up and put him in a corner. He had to stay there all night, no dancing and no fun.
The next day, James had learned his lesson. He knew to be a good boy and not be so naughty. From that day forward, he always listened to his mom and never danced the night away again.
