Once upon a time there was a little boy, who was very confused. He went to a store and saw a notebook. He was curious and wanted to take a closer look, so he stole the notebook.
When he opened it, he noticed a lot of words he couldn't understand. He thought it was very pretty and decided to keep it.
Later, the store keepers saw him with the notebook and ran after him. He was so scared, he started to run.
The store keeper yelled, “Stop! You stole that notebook!” The little boy got scared and dropped the notebook. He started to cry and ran away.
The store keeper was so angry and said, “I can't believe you stole this notebook! You should have just asked me for it.” 
The little boy was so confused and scared, he never went back to the store again. He learnt his lesson that stealing is wrong.
