Tom and Mia were very excited to see the fireworks. They put on their warm coats and hats and went outside with their mom and dad. They walked to the park where many people were waiting for the show.
"Mom, what are fireworks?" Mia asked.
"Fireworks are bright and loud things that fly in the sky. They are made of fire and colors and shapes. People make them to celebrate and have fun," mom explained.
"Wow, they sound amazing! Can we make them too?" Tom asked.
"No, sweetie, fireworks are very dangerous. Only grown-ups who know how to be safe can make them. We can watch them and enjoy them, but we have to stay far away from them," dad explained.
Soon, the fireworks started. Tom and Mia clapped and cheered as they saw the red, blue, green, and yellow sparks and stars and flowers in the dark sky. They oohed and aahed as they heard the loud booms and cracks and whistles. They felt happy and amazed.
But then, it started to rain. The raindrops were cold and wet and made the fireworks less bright and clear. The people started to leave the park and go back to their homes.
"Aw, the rain ruined the fireworks!" Tom complained.
"No, it didn't. The fireworks were still beautiful and fun. And we can see them again another time. Besides, the rain is good for the plants and the animals and the earth," mom explained.
"Really?" Mia asked.
"Yes, really. Rain is part of nature, just like fire and colors and shapes. Everything has a reason and a purpose. Sometimes we don't understand them, but we can appreciate them," dad explained.
Tom and Mia nodded. They hugged their mom and dad and thanked them for taking them to see the fireworks. They didn't mind being wet and cold, because they had seen something wonderful and learned something new. They went home and had hot chocolate and cookies and went to bed, dreaming of fireworks and rain.
