The young seaman tugged at my sleeve, " Captain look ! Out there ! To starboard ! "

I took the binoculars hanging on my neck and glassed the waters, calm seas, except for what looked to be a single white mass, kind of like a wave.

" Do you see it sir? "

" Well. . . I think so. Is that a rogue wave? "

A tower of foam spurt through the water, and the " white mass " was what looked like a gargantuan white tail that lifted into the air, and then disappeared into the water. But that couldn't be. . .

" Jesus Christ, what was that? ", I screamed.

" Sir, that looks like Moby Dick ! "

" *What? * "

" Moby Dick, Captain ! "

" I heard you the first time. How on God's green planet do you figure that is Moby Dick? "

" I figured it out from the tail. . . the white tail, Captain. "

I raised the binoculars to the waters again, but any sign of this " Moby Dick " was gone. Whatever it was, it had disappeared.

I heard the seaman cough behind me, " Ahem. . . Sir. . . You do know how to fight Moby, right? "

" Jesus Christ son, there's no such thing as Moby Dick. "

His eyes widened as his face became very Moby Dick-colored-like, " Begging your pardon Sir. . . But yes there is. Did n't you ever read the book in your training? "

" You mean that book by uhh. . what's his name. . . umm. . . Charles Dick. . . Charles Dickinson? "

He pinched his nose with his fingers, " Oh my God. "

I laughed, " Is this some sort of joke? Seriously? Like, some sort of 'Oh hey, we have a new Captain, so let's fuck with him ' kind of thing? "

" N-no. . . Sir. All sea captains are required to read Moby Dick by *Herman Melville* before taking command of a ship. "

" You 're starting to piss me off now son. Moby Dick is a fucking novel. "

Another young seaman's voice sounded on the horn, " *Captain ! We 've detected a large mass below us on SONAR. It's Moby Dick ! No submarine can move as fast as what we 're picking up ! * "

As sarcastically as I could humanly muster, with as much animation in my hands as possible, I laughed, " Well all hands to battle stations then ! "

** " *ALL HANDS TO BATTLE STATIONS ! ALL HANDS TO BATTLE STATIONS ! THIS IS NOT A DRILL ! I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL ! * " **

The ship's siren blared, and strobe lights hanging on the ceiling and on the deck that I didn't even know existed started panickly spinning about, shining their red lights all over the walls. Sailors sprinted about, down below I saw the Chief screaming orders, and my 1st Officer ran up on deck. He was breathless, and the look of unadulterated terror was in his eyes.

" Captain, what's our next move? ! "

" Jesus Christ, am I the only one who isn't fucking crazy? There's no such thing as Moby Dick ! "

The 1st Officer looked at me and blinked.

" Now is not the time for games sir ! "

The seaman chimed in, " The Captain is being serious, sir. "

" Captain, please tell me you 've read Moby Dick. "

" What? I read like a *third* of it in High School, but that's it ! It was a fucking boring book ! "

" Captain ! Half that book is about how to kill whales ! "

" I *know*, that's why it was so goddamn fucking boring ! "

The 1st Officer was now jumping up and down, his fingers pulling out his hair, " How the hell do you expect to kill Moby Dick, if you 've never *read* Moby Dick? "

" *BECAUSE IT WAS A FUCKING NOVEL ! * "

A huge, vibrating, animalistic roar shook the entire ship. I rushed to the window and much to my horror and disbelief, out of the water, a colossal white whale launched itself into the air, easily two times the size of our old frigate. A diety, spawn of Poseidon. The very definition of behomoth itself. It soared out of the water, mouth agape, and its shadow covered the entire ship. Before it landed on top of us, the very last thought I had before being snuffed off the face of this planet was, *I wish I had n't smoked so much pot in high school. *
