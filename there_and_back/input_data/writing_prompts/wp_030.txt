Okay. I 'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun.

This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere they are less dense and thus tend to have less attraction due to gravity. Thus, while planets in closer orbits move faster and are blistered, tornado-swept hellholes, ones in more distant orbits move more slowly and have fewer issues with wind.

( So what keeps these orbits from decaying in the face of air resistance? I dunno. Though that might be a story hook. )

Now imagine a primitive society ( Bronze Age? Renaissance? ) who is just learning to escape their planet's gravity well using, say, giant kites that catch the occasional hugely-strong high-altitude winds that happen when their planet intersects the convection current. How do they explore this huge sea of " space "? Are there others out there? Does their emerging science catch the inconsistencies in their own universe? If so, what do they make of it?

Yeah, I know there's a lot of hand-waving and general bullshit here, but gim me a break : I 'm making it up as I go along. Besides, if you 're creating a new universe, you can make the physics do whatever you want.
