( This isn't exactly from Civ 5, but from another strategy game I love even more. )

We are a hardy people. We have to be. The Reconquista by the bastard nations of Portugal, Castile and Aragon has driven us from our native home lands. I was a boy when I saw our capital burn, and I still recall the tears my father wept as Granada burned to the ground.

But, my anger is with the bastard nations, not with their god. Allah is great, and has room in His kingdom for all men of the book. We fled south, my father taking our broken nation to the lands given to us by Morocco. My father knew we would have to rebuild again. He turned those harsh lands into the fertile grounds for the New Granadian empire.

I was only 15 when I took my fathers throne for him. I spent the rest of my life making Granada great again. I built the great ships we have used to settle the Americas. I alone moved the capital to the Caribbean seas, and built New Granada with the finest architects money could buy.

I led our navies in battle against the bastard nations, and few cheered louder than I when we sunk the Portuguese navy. We are the gatekeepers for the Americas. I have built vast plantations for sugar, farm estates for grains, and great trading houses to sell our many slaves and war prisoners.

I am an old man now, and I have left many sons to rule this kingdom well. My time to rejoin Allah is coming near, and I do not fear that day. We have taken these lands, and shaped them. Molded them for Allah, and for the glory of the Sunni faith. I have nothing to fear, and look forward to seeing my father again in Paradise.
