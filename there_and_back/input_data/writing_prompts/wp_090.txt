It was the eve of November 4th, 2008. As he looked in the mirror, he took a deep breath. He was not looking forward to tomorrow because, regardless of what happened, he was getting some bad news. He adjusted his earmuffs ; they were filled with a sizeable amount of ice, like most celebrities ' were. This is the curse to being famous, he thought, you have to deal with the consequences. In a way, he sort of hoped that he would just lose, just so that he wouldn't have to suffer the infamous burning. While he had had to deal with this pain for a good portion of his adult life, he knew that whatever had come before would pale in comparison to the immense scorching sensation that he would feel tomorrow. Next to no one else would ever be forced to deal with the level of constant pain that he would endure, but, he thought, the others before him had succeeded, so why can't he? Even if it hurt, he knew how great it would sound to hear the words " President Obama ". That is, if he could hear at all.
