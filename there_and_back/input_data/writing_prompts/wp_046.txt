Tuesday :
I met someone today. I think it is the beginning of a long lasting friendship. I was in a very unfamiliar place, and my new friend took me under his arm ( so to speak ) and made me feel very comfortable. His voice is very soothing to me. . . only. . . I can't understand a damn thing he says ! He does n't speak my language, nor I his. So I call him 'Frederick. ' I wonder if he has a name for me, as well. Most of the time he just makes this clicking sound ! What language could that even be? Frederick offered me some food. He is very kind ! The food was unlike anything I 've ever had before, but delicious all the same. I think I could eat it everyday and never tire of it !

Wednesday :
I returned to Frederick's today. He didn't seem bothered by my presence at all ! In fact, he seemed overjoyed to see me again. He made me some more of that delicious food. He even invited me to spend the night. . . but I declined. I didn't feel quite ready for that. He is pretty great though. He makes me feel so safe and secure.

Thursday :
I am writing this at Frederick's place. I decided to stay the night. His bed is so comfortable ! I think we have come up with an efficient way to communicate too. I would rather we spoke the same language, but I could get use to this. : )

Friday :
I. . . I don't know what to say. Things did not go as planned today. Not. At. All. I 'm not sure I can trust Frederick anymore. We cuddled all night long. I thought we had something special ! But this morning. . . I can barely write out the words. . . but he took me to this place. It was very bright with strange people in white coats. They held me down. . . on a cold metal table and gave me a shot. When I awoke, Frederick was nowhere to be found and. . . and neither were my balls. They took them from me !

Saturday :
I 'm back at Frederick's place. I think I will stay here. He keeps making me that delicious food and I love it when he scratches behind my ears. Maybe I didn't need my balls anyway. . .
