He's the worst kind of dealer

the one who always has what you want

and has no problem getting high off of his own supply

In public, he's the perfect business man

with promises that he will fulfill, I can tell you that

and he 'll seal that deal with only a few words

With his blue eyes and amazing smile

it's impossible to say no,

especially when he has what you need

but once you 're behind closed doors with him

your heart races, your vision blurs, and heat engulfs you

You and him could spend a whole day in bed

basking in that high he sells, that afterglow of it all

You savor every touch, every smell, every taste

and each moment is ingrained in your mind like track marks

The worst part is when you have to leave

then the withdrawals kick in, and you 're fucked

Your memories replay everything and you can swear,

swear upon everything you are and you have

that you can feel his fingers on your side,

his lips on your neck, his weight just barely on top of you

Your body craves more and you can't provide

so you sit and count down the days until

you can see him next

and get that high you 've always wanted
