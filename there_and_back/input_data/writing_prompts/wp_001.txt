Having a TV flicker on in a silent, empty house is always unnerving. So when I heard the static and the echoes of voices while I was raiding the pantry, I nearly jumped out of my skin.

I grabbed my baseball bat and crept from the kitchen into the living room, where I could tell the voices were emanating from, wondering if someone had broken into the house. I was far from proficient at self-defense, but if worse came to worse, I would go down fighting. I steeled myself, preparing for the coming violence. Taking a deep breath and hoisting the bat above my shoulder, I inched along the wall next to the door.

With a loud " Ha ! " I jumped into the room, only to be faced with a flickering TV screen. My adrenaline rush fizzled out as soon as it had started. " Oh God, " I muttered to myself. " Ridiculous. It's only the television. "

But it took about a second for me to realize that the TV had turned on by itself. Suspicion made me squint my eyes once more. I backed into a corner of the room, eyes jumping from the TV to the patio doors.

On the TV, one of those famous telecasters you never remember the names of was steadily looking at the camera, speaking calmly.

" It is a grave time in US history, " he was saying. " This message was recorded when it became clear that the biological arms race was not going to de-escalate. If you are hearing this today, a final offensive has been launched. "

Surprise brought my full attention back to the TV, as I lowered my bat. I 'd heard there was a pre-recorded tape, but I had thought they were only rumors. The surprise warred with the fear in my chest.

" We believe that several major cities have or will soon be hit with deadly microbial agents. At this time we urge citizens to stay inside and to tightly close doors and windows. Our country's armed forces are poised to respond to the threat with an offensive of their own, however at this time it is impossible to mitigate the damages of enemy attacks on american soil.

We regret to say that this broadcast will most likely be our last, but we wish to remind our compatriots that the U. S. A. is a proud nation of people who have overcome overwhelming odds, and that this situation will be no different. We must stay together as a nation, as a people. Goodbye America. . . and Goodnight. "

The telecaster signed off with his signature wink, though it seemed very forced and he had tears in his eyes. Then, the TV cut to static, as I continued to stare at it, aghast.

This was. . . unprecedented. Unexpected. Something was very, very wrong. I hoisted my bat on my shoulder once again. I was going to need it. I went to the open window, breathing deep, and listened.

Yes. . . Yes, I could hear it.

The far away hum of a generator. Someone had turned the town's hydro-powered grid back on, after years of disuse. Who? Why? I needed to keep my people safe. I needed to know.

I gritted my teeth and walked out of the ruined house, into the deserted, wasted town. Behind me, the newly-powered TV flickered back to the broadcast, the voice of a man ten years dead following me out, announcing the apocalypse that had been his end. . . but not mine.
