It was the 2017 State of the Union. By now, the economy had tanked harder than ever before in American history. People were out of their homes, most of the real estate belonged to a single family.

" Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States ", announced a man near the end of a large room full of men in suits. For the first time in modern history there was no applause. The president walked the length of the room to the podium, standing in front of Speaker Paul Ryan and Vice President Cruz.

" Thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have made America great again ".
