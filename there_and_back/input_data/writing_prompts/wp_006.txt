" I don'tsa get it, " Jar Jar said as he sat down on the broken wing of a tie fighter, " I didn't wantsa to bring aboutsa the empire, why are people mad at mesa. "

" Jar jar, " Finn said wrapping a hand around the alien, " you just got ta accept that. "

" Nosa, " Jar jar said as the music started to swell, " theysa just don't understand me. "

" Jar? " Finn began, but the alien could no longer hear him as he looked up into the Jakku sun.

*I might not be a Jedi, but I know who I am, *

*I might be off my planet, but I 've got ta be a man*

*Because we 've broken the rules, but now we need to bend it*

Finn stands up in the background, and joins in.

*If we 're going to be able to be in love, we need to bring back*

*The senate* Jarjar finishes while staring into Finns eyes. He glances down at the lightsaber on his hip, " I knowsa that I have n't worked with a jedi since Annie, "

" Shh, " Finn said as he put a finger over Jarjar's lips, " That's all in the past. "

" No, " Jarjar sighed, " It wasn'tsa. " he begins to sing again.

*I gave the senate to palpatine*

*but now you 're standing here with me*

*and I wo n't let you see the dark*

*like I failed Annie*

*This is a galaxy and I feel so far far away*

*but as long as I " m here with you I feel like that's okay*

*And maybe it's just me not knowing who I am*

*but I wantsa you, to be my mannnnnnnnn*

The music picks up and Finn joins in on the signing.

Finn : *Is this going to be Tabboo on Naboo? *

Jarjar : *Only if it's with you*

Finn : *I will forsake my jedi vows* ( Hold note )

Jarjar : *I will forget the past* ( hold note, close with Finn )

Finn : *but there is something that we need to do for noooooow*

Jarjar looks over the horizon, " I love you Finn. "

" I know. "

Han Solo appears over the rock, " Are you two ready to go? "

Jarjar brushes his ear out of the way, " Yeah, I think so. "
