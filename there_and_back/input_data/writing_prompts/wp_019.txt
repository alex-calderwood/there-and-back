Damn, I knew I had n't been careful. I quickly stuffed the journal into my waist sack and stood up and stretched. It was imperative for me to destroy evidence of my arrival and as such I knew what had to be done. I was lucky that this was early in the find. The end of this week we had been planning on moving our findings to our sorting site so we could process these belongings, belongings that were, are mine. God, I 'm getting confused with my time.

That night I packed the perimeter and middle with a chain explosives. In the morning I faked sick and they left me to recover. Once all of my crew was at dig site I left the area in the Humvee. Several kilometers out I felt far away enough to press the big red button. The sound of the explosion reached me in the matter of seconds and made a vibration in the ground.

I waited 3 hours before I went back to insure all was destroyed. I sighed in relief and dug the journal out. A flame from my lighter was quick to destroy it. I laughed in glee.
