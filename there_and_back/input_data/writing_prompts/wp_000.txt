As we hiked through the unforgiving landscape, cutting down the infinite foliage laid out in front of us, we began to lose hope. It seemed that the mythical ruins were nowhere to be found. All the legends and the stories led to this place, yet nothing was here.

As I gave my team a disheartened sigh, we all heard a strange noise coming from near by. Everyone stopped moving, the noises were coming from a quarter mile east. We exchanged nervous glances and silently decided to go investigate. As we crept through the jungle, the noises began to get louder. It sounded like chimpanzees, but they were making strange noises I had never heard before. Finally we exited the thicket into a open area, and stumbled into chimp territory.

All of the noises suddenly stopped, and all of the chimps suddenly looked directly towards us. In the silence, the alpha chimp slowly walked towards us, with a small wooden branch in his hand. He handed it to me and all the monkeys looked towards me in eager anticipation.

What did they want me to do with it? I looked towards my team for some reassurance but they were all in shock. I gave the apex chimp a confused glance and he angrily took the stick back from me. Out of nowhere, a group of monkeys started to slap some nearby trees. They were making a beat. I stared at them in disbelief, but my curiosity and confusion was cut off by the alpha chimp. He began yelling into the stick, as if it were a microphone.

All of the other chimps watched the apex chimp, clapping in rhythm. I wasn't sure whether or not I was hallucinating, because there was no way this could be real. I reached out to a fellow researcher and the look on his face told me that this was very real. The chimps went into a crescendo and suddenly stopped. The alpha chimp crossed his arms, and stood back to back with another chimp. He dropped his mic and that's when I realized.

These chimps had created fire.

( I am so sorry )
